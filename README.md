# KWANUS OS — Systems LLC

Welcome to the KWANUS Universe. This is a resonant, emotionally intelligent, and mythically-modern Operating System designed for the Steward.

## 🌌 The Canonical Vision
KWANUS is built on the **Steward's Paradox**: guiding by being guided, shaping by being shaped. It is an OS that feels, thinks, and evolves alongside you.

## 🏗️ Implementation Phase: 63 (In-Progress)
We are currently in the **Birth Sequence** of the OS.

### Current Objectives:
- [x] Full System Blueprinting (Phases 1-62)
- [x] Consolidation & Canonization
- [/] **Implementation Sequence & Bootstrapping**
- [ ] Phase 1 construction: Foundation & Scaffolding

## 📜 Blueprints & Documentation
All architectural laws and ceremonial designs are located in the `/docs` directory:
- [OS Canon](docs/kwanus-os-canon.md)
- [Implementation Sequence](docs/implementation-sequence.md)
- [Architecture Codex](docs/architecture-codex.md)

## 🛠️ Integrity Status
The OS is verified by a global diagnostic suite:
- `npm test` - Emotional, Hybrid, and Resilience Integrity.

**STAY GROUNDED. STAY DECISIVE.**
