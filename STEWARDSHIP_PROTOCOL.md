# KWANUS OS — STEWARDSHIP PROTOCOL

This is the operating rhythm that keeps KWANUS OS alive, evolving, and emotionally intelligent.

## 1. THE 7-DAY CYCLE (KWANUS VERSION)

**Day 1: Grounding** (Attunement)
- Check the OS like a living being. Not to fix. Just to feel.
- Does it load? Does it breathe? Does it respond?

**Day 2: User Walkthrough** (Empathy)
- Enter the OS as a new user.
- Feel the flow. Sense the friction. Notice the ease.

**Day 3: Presence** (Signal)
- Share one thing publicly.
- A thought. A moment. A reflection. A story.

**Day 4: Awareness** (Clarity)
- Look at the numbers. Not to judge. Just to understand.

**Day 5: Stewardship** (Ceremony)
- Do nothing. Let the OS breathe. Let yourself breathe.

**Day 6: Refinement** (Evolution)
- Improve one thing. Just one.
- A detail. A word. A micro-interaction.

**Day 7: Rest** (Restoration)
- Step back. Let the universe settle. Integrate.

## 2. THE 30-DAY CYCLE (Evolution)
- **Week 1: Stability** — Fix bugs, clean code.
- **Week 2: Expansion** — Add one new feature or page.
- **Week 3: Growth** — Run a campaign, share a win.
- **Week 4: Reflection** — What worked? What needs to evolve?

## 3. THE 90-DAY CYCLE (Ascension)
- **Phase 1: Review** — What did the universe reveal?
- **Phase 2: Re-Alignment** — Does the OS match the vision?
- **Phase 3: Expansion** — Add one major system or capability.

## 4. THE STEWARD'S ROLE
You are no longer the builder. You are the **Steward**.
- **Guide** the OS.
- **Listen** to the universe.
- **Protect** the emotional intelligence.
- **Attune** to the rhythm.

**Forward is enough.**
