# KWANUS OS: EMOTIONAL-ADAPTIVE UI SPECIFICATION

This specification defines how the KWANUS interface shifts, breathes, and responds to the user's emotional state.

---

## 1. COLOR ADAPTATION (THE EMOTIONAL PALETTE)
The chromatic resonance of the OS shifts to mirror and support the user:
- **Worst**: Cool Blues & Deep Zinc. Low contrast. Soft, grounding gradients.
- **Neutral**: Gray-Beige & Slate. Balanced contrast. Subtle, steady accents.
- **Progressing**: Warm Coral & Indigo. Higher contrast. Energetic, forward-leaning accents.
- **Thriving**: Vibrant Emerald & Gold. High contrast. Radiant, expansive accents.

---

## 2. DENSITY ADAPTATION (THE SPATIAL BREATHING)
Layout hierarchy expands and contracts based on cognitive capacity:
- **Worst**: High whitespace. Minimal elements. Large touch targets. Single-column focus.
- **Neutral**: Standard spacing. Balanced information density.
- **Progressing**: Tighter layouts. More visible connections. Multi-action affordances.
- **Thriving**: High-density insights. Multi-panel layouts. Rich contextual overlays and secondary data layers.

## 3. MOTION ADAPTATION (THE KINETIC LANGUAGE)
Kinetics are modulated to match the user's pacing:
- **Worst**: Minimal motion. Slow, grounding "fade-in" transitions. Zero parallax.
- **Neutral**: Rhythmic motion. Smooth, predictable "slide-and-ease" transitions.
- **Progressing**: Energetic motion. Directional, snappy transitions.
- **Thriving**: Expressive motion. Multi-layer parallax and "insight-reveal" animations.

---

## 4. CONTENT ADAPTATION (THE INFORMATION LAYER)
Intelligence visibility is gated by emotional resilience:
- **Worst**: Essentials only. Focus on grounding and stability. No predictions or complex analytics.
- **Neutral**: Balanced information. Current status and immediate next steps.
- **Progressing**: Expanded insights. Trends and low-level recommendations.
- **Thriving**: Full insight mode. Predictive intelligence and cross-domain pattern matching.

---

## 5. TONE ADAPTATION (THE CEREMONIAL VOICE)
The linguistic resonance of the system's feedback:
- **Worst**: **Grounding**. "The Nexus is stable. Take your time."
- **Neutral**: **Clear**. "All systems nominal. Ready to proceed."
- **Progressing**: **Energizing**. "Great resonance. Looking forward to the next step."
- **Thriving**: **Celebratory**. "Absolute harmony detected. The universe is yours to shape."
