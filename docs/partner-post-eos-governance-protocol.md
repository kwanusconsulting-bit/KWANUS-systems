# KWANUS OS — Partner Post‑EoS Governance Protocol (PartnerPostEoSSpec)
A complete protocol defining how the KWANUS Operating System ecosystem handles former partners, archived metadata, historical workflows, and long‑term governance after End‑of‑Support (EoS).

This document defines:
- post‑EoS governance rules  
- metadata archiving  
- historical workflow handling  
- compliance after EoS  
- ecosystem impact review  
- long‑term data rules  
- partner re‑entry rules  
- governance updates  
- sustainability updates  
- long‑term stewardship  

It ensures the ecosystem remains clean, stable, and coherent long after a partner’s lifecycle ends.
