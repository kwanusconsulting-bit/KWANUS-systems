A complete framework defining how partners are onboarded, governed, integrated, monitored, and maintained within the KWANUS Operating System ecosystem.

This document defines:
- partner tiers  
- onboarding workflow  
- integration rules  
- permission boundaries  
- compliance requirements  
- monitoring rules

# 1. Partner Philosophy

Partners must be:
- aligned  
- governed  
- secure  
- compatible  
- sustainable  
- accountable  

Partnership is not access — it is **responsible collaboration**.

Partnership ensures:
- ecosystem growth  
- workflow expansion  
- developer innovation  
- user value  
- long‑term stability

# 2. Partner Tiers

## Tier 1 — Read‑Only Partners
- read‑only API access  
- no workflow triggers  
- no write operations  
- lowest risk  

## Tier 2 — Workflow Partners
- workflow triggers allowed  
- limited write operations  
- moderate risk  
- requires security review  

## Tier 3 — Intelligence Partners
- advanced API access  
- predictive workflows  
- high risk  
- requires full governance review  

---

# 3. Partner Onboarding Workflow

## Step 1 — Application
Partner submits:
- business justification  
- technical overview  
- security overview  
- compliance overview  
- requested tier  
- requested permissions  

## Step 2 — Initial Review
Reviewed by:
- TSC (technical)  
- SCO (security)  
- ERC (extension impact)  
- CGB (ecosystem impact)  

## Step 3 — Risk Assessment
- risk scoring  
- mitigation plan  
- fallback plan  

## Step 4 — Approval
- majority approval required  
- CGB has final authority  

## Step 5 — Integration
- API keys  
- permissions  
- workflows  
- documentation  

## Step 6 — Monitoring
- workflow reliability  
- permission usage  
- API usage
