# KWANUS OS — Partner Sanctions & Restrictions Manual (PartnerSanctionsManual)
The complete operational manual detailing every sanction, restriction, freeze, lock, and enforcement action within the KWANUS Operating System partner universe.

This manual defines:
- sanction types  
- restriction types  
- freeze types  
- lock types  
- enforcement actions  
- severity levels  
- triggers  
- thresholds  
- durations  
- reversibility rules  
- governance authority  
- ceremonial enforcement steps  

It is the **tactical enforcement engine** of the partner universe.

# 1. Sanction Philosophy

Sanctions must be:
- corrective, not punitive  
- ceremonial, not chaotic  
- predictable, not arbitrary  
- reversible (until EoS)  
- governed, not automated alone  
- emotionally intelligent  
- lifecycle‑aligned  
- sustainability‑aligned  

Sanctions exist to **restore alignment**, not punish.

# 2. Sanction Severity Levels

Sanctions are divided into **five severity levels**:

| Level | Description | Authority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1** | Notice | OS Automated Governance |
| **Level 2** | Warning | ERC (The Weaver) |
| **Level 3** | Restriction | TSC + SCO (Architects & Sentinels) |
| **Level 4** | Governance Review | All Councils |
| **Level 5** | Withdrawal | CGB (The Balancekeeper) |

# 3. Sanction Types

Sanctions fall into four categories:

## Category A — Capability Sanctions
- **Capability Freeze**: Immediate halt on new capability expansion.
- **Capability Throttle**: Reduced execution speed or resource allocation.
- **Capability Rollback**: Reversion to a previously stable state.
- **Capability Quarantine**: Isolation of a single capability for auditing.

## Category B — Permission Sanctions
- **Permission Freeze**: Locking of existing permissions (cannot be modified).
- **Permission Reduction**: Forcible removal of high-risk permissions.
- **Permission Revocation**: Removal of specific access strands.
- **Permission Quarantine**: Monitoring of permission use in isolation.

## Category C — Workflow Sanctions
- **Workflow Freeze**: Halting of the three-part workflow lifecycle.
- **Workflow Throttle**: Rate-limiting of workflow executions.
- **Workflow Disable**: Full shutdown of specific threads.
- **Workflow Quarantine**: Sandboxing of workflow execution.

## Category D — Tier Sanctions
- **Tier Freeze**: Prevention of evolution to high-capability tiers.
- **Tier Rollback**: Forcible descent to a lower-capability tier.
- **Tier Quarantine**: Isolation of a tier's entire capability set.

# 4. Restriction Types

Restrictions are functional limits placed on partners.

## 1. API Restrictions
- **Read-Only Mode**: Write access is fully suspended.
- **Write-Limit Mode**: Throttled write execution.
- **Endpoint-Specific Blocks**: Specific gates are locked.
- **Rate Limits**: Temporal throttling of request frequency.

## 2. Workflow Restrictions
- **Trigger Limits**: Reduced number of allowed stimulus events.
- **Handler Limits**: Reduced number of allowed execution responses.
- **Concurrency Limits**: Fewer simultaneous threads.
- **Workflow-Specific Blocks**: Particular looms are halted.

## 3. Permission Restrictions
- **Write → Read Downgrade**: Forcible reduction of agency.
- **Intelligence → Workflow Downgrade**: Removal of intelligence runtimes.
- **Workflow → Read-Only Downgrade**: Removal of active execution strands.

## 4. Intelligence Restrictions
- **Intelligence Runtime Pause**: Temporary suspension of thinking layers.
- **Intelligence Runtime Throttle**: Reduced compute allocation.
- **Intelligence Runtime Disable**: Shutdown of cognitive capabilities.

# 5. Freeze Types

Freezes are temporary, protective halts.

- **Capability Freeze**: Partner cannot request or use new capabilities.
- **Permission Freeze**: Partner cannot modify existing access patterns.
- **Workflow Freeze**: Partner cannot create or modify execution strands.
- **Tier Freeze**: Partner cannot evolve or expand.

Freezes are utilized during:
- Drift detection
- Audit periods
- Remediation cycles
- Active Governance Review

---

# 6. Lock Types

Locks are architectural interventions stronger than freezes.

- **Capability Lock**: Capabilities are disabled until explicit governance approval.
- **Permission Lock**: Permissions are reduced to a minimal baseline.
- **Workflow Lock**: All workflows are fully disabled.
- **Tier Lock**: Tier is forcibly rolled back to a compliant state.

Locks are deployed only at **Level 4** (Review) and **Level 5** (Withdrawal).

---

# 7. Enforcement Actions

| Severity | Actions Taken |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1 — Notice** | Drift alert, alignment reminder, ceremonial dimming. |
| **Level 2 — Warning** | Remediation required, Capability/Workflow freeze. |
| **Level 3 — Restriction** | Permission reduction, Workflow/Capability throttle, Intelligence pause. |
| **Level 4 — Review** | Capability/Workflow lock, Tier freeze, Council Judgment. |
| **Level 5 — Withdrawal** | Permission revocation, Workflow disable, Tier rollback, EoS initiation. |

---

# 8. Durations & Reversibility

| Sanction Level | Default Duration | Reversibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Notice** | Immediate | Automatic on alignment. |
| **Warning** | 7 Days | Reversible after ERC validation. |
| **Restriction** | 30 Days | Reversible after TSC/SCO review. |
| **Review** | Until Judgment | Determined by CGB. |
| **Withdrawal** | Permanent | Irreversible. |

# 9. Ceremonial Steps

1. **The Signal (Notice)**: "The strands drift. Realign."
2. **The Flicker (Warning)**: "The loom frays. Restore the weave."
3. **The Narrowing (Restriction)**: "The gate narrows. Proceed with care."
4. **The Glow (Review)**: "The Compass glows. The councils gather."
5. **The Dimming (Withdrawal)**: "The light dims. Prepare for release."
6. **The Closure (EoS)**: "The gate closes."
7. **The Knot (Memory)**: "The Archive Knot holds your story."

# 10. Summary

The Partner Sanctions & Restrictions Manual provides the **tactical precision** required to govern the partner universe. It ensures that every enforcement action is predictable, ceremonial, and aligned with the structural integrity of the KWANUS Operating System.
