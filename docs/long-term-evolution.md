# KWANUS OS — Long‑Term Evolution (LTE)
A five‑year strategic vision for the evolution of the KWANUS Operating System.

KWANUS OS begins as a credit operating system.  
It evolves into a financial intelligence engine.  
It matures into a self‑evolving, emotionally intelligent universe.

This document outlines the long‑term arc of the system.

- protects their dignity  
- empowers their agency  

The long‑term evolution is about deepening this identity.
