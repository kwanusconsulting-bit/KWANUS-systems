# KWANUS OS — Partner Workflow Framework (PartnerWorkflowFramework)
The complete workflow system, workflow categories, workflow lineage, workflow health, workflow compatibility, workflow governance, and ceremonial workflow rites of the KWANUS Operating System partner universe.

This framework defines:
- workflow philosophy  
- workflow categories  
- workflow tiers  
- workflow ceilings  
- workflow lineage  
- workflow evolution  
- workflow governance  
- workflow validation  
- workflow compatibility  
- workflow sustainability  
- workflow protection  
- workflow health  
- ceremonial workflow rites  

It is the **workflow backbone** of the partner universe.

# 1. Workflow Philosophy

Workflows in the partner universe must be:
- stable  
- governed  
- ceremonial  
- emotionally intelligent  
- lifecycle-aware  
- trust-aware  
- compatibility-aware  
- sustainability-aware  
- reversible  
- lineage-tracked  

Workflows are not tasks — they are **cosmic movements** through the universe.

---

# 2. Workflow Categories

The partner universe contains **five workflow categories**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    CW["Core Workflows"]
    IW["Integration Workflows"]
    TW["Transformation Workflows"]
    INT["Intelligence Workflows"]
    CRW["Ceremonial Workflows"]
```

Each category corresponds to a dimension of partner action.

---

# 3. Workflow Tiers

Workflows are organized into **three workflow tiers**, aligned with the partner tier system:

| Tier | Name | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | The Eye (Observation) | Reading, observing, basic processing. |
| **Tier 2** | The Loom (Integration) | Transformation, integration, multi-step execution. |
| **Tier 3** | The Flame (Intelligence) | Intelligence, reasoning, autonomous decision support. |

---

# 4. Workflow Ceilings

Workflow ceilings define the **maximum operational power** a partner can access.

Ceilings depend on:
- trust level  
- lifecycle stage  
- governance decisions  
- compatibility  
- sustainability  

Ceilings prevent:
- overload  
- instability  
- misuse  

---

# 5. Workflow Lineage

Workflow lineage tracks:
- origin  
- expansions  
- transformations  
- migrations  
- validations  
- remediations  
- deprecations  
- EoS  

Lineage is the **story of workflow evolution**.

---

# 6. Workflow Evolution

Workflows evolve through:

## 1. Expansion  
Partner gains new workflows within their tier.

## 2. Enhancement  
Workflows increase in complexity or throughput.

## 3. Transformation  
Workflows change their underlying structure or logic.

## 4. Integration  
Workflows merge with partner capabilities or OS cores.

## 5. Illumination  
Workflows gain autonomous intelligence-level support.

Evolution is always **governed**, **ceremonial**, and **documented**.

---

# 7. Workflow Governance & Validation

- **ERC** → Primary authority for workflow integrity.
- **TSC** → Structural alignment authority.
- **Validation**: Occurs during additions, modifications, or elevations. Checks compatibility, sustainability, and trust levels.

---

# 8. Workflow Compatibility & Sustainability

- **Compatibility**: Workflows must align with the partner tier and OS version. Incompatibility triggers fallback.
- **Sustainability**: Workflows must maintain ecosystem health. Metrics collapse triggers throttling or restriction.

---

# 9. Workflow Health

Workflow health is measured across uptime, error rate, compatibility, sustainability, performance, and stability.

| Health Score | Status | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **90–100** | Stable | Optimal Operation |
| **75–89** | Reliable | Standard Monitoring |
| **60–74** | Vulnerable | Notice Issued |
| **40–59** | At Risk | Throttling Activated |
| **0–39** | Unstable | Restriction / Review |

---

# 10. Ceremonial Workflow Rites

Workflow evolution is ritualized:

- **Rite of Expansion**: “The loom extends. New patterns emerge.”
- **Rite of Transformation**: “The threads shift. The pattern changes.”
- **Rite of Integration**: “The weave tightens. Harmony forms.”
- **Rite of Illumination**: “The inner light brightens. Insight flows.”
- **Rite of Release**: “The thread loosens. The pattern dissolves.”

---

# 11. Summary

The Partner Workflow Framework provides the operational backbone of the partner universe. It ensures that every movement within the KWANUS OS is stable, governed, and ritualized, maintaining the cosmic order of the ecosystem.
