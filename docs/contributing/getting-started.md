# Contributing to KWANUS OS

Welcome, Steward.

## Philosophy
Every line of code is a ceremonial act. Maintain the rhythm, the steadiness, and the mythic modernity of the OS.

## Rituals
1. **Consistency**: Use the canonical `@/components/ui` primitives.
2. **Resonance**: Ensure every feature is emotional-adaptive.
3. **Intelligence**: New logic must integrate with the `EventRouter`.

## Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev-setup
npm run dev
```

## Testing
```bash
npm test
```
