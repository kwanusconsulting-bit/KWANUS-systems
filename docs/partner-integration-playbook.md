# KWANUS OS — Partner Integration Playbook (PartnerIntegrationPlaybook)
A complete operational, technical, and governance playbook defining how newly approved partner capabilities, tiers, and integrations are introduced into the KWANUS Operating System ecosystem.

This document defines:
- integration workflow  
- technical integration steps  
- governance checkpoints  
- compatibility validation  
- security validation  
- documentation requirements  
- rollout strategy  
- monitoring requirements  
- integration sign‑off  
- long‑term partner integration stewardship  

It ensures partner integrations enter the KWANUS OS safely, predictably, and sustainably.

# 1. Integration Philosophy

Partner integration must be:
- safe  
- governed  
- predictable  
- reversible  
- compatible  
- sustainable  

Integration is not simply enabling access — it is **introducing a new actor into a living ecosystem**.

Integration ensures:
- ecosystem coherence  
- workflow reliability  
- partner accountability  
- user safety
