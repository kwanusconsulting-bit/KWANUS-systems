# KWANUS OS — Partner Lifecycle Specification (PartnerLifecycleSpec)
A complete specification defining how partners move through their lifecycle from onboarding to deprecation within the KWANUS Operating System ecosystem.

This document defines:
- partner lifecycle stages  
- lifecycle rules  
- onboarding requirements  
- maintenance requirements  
- deprecation rules  
- end‑of‑support rules  
- migration requirements  
- lifecycle governance  
- long‑term partner stewardship  

It ensures partners operate predictably, safely, and sustainably across all ecosystem eras.

# 1. Lifecycle Philosophy

Partner lifecycle management must be:
- predictable  
- governed  
- sustainable  
- compatible  
- secure  
- long‑term oriented  

Lifecycle ensures:
- partner accountability  
- workflow reliability  
- ecosystem stability  
- long‑term viability  

---

# 2. Universal Partner Lifecycle Stages

All partners follow the same four lifecycle stages:

## Stage 1 — **Active**
- full access  
- workflows enabled  
- permissions granted  
- integrations stable  

## Stage 2 — **Maintenance**
- limited updates  
- compliance checks required  
- workflow reliability monitored  
- permissions reviewed  

## Stage 3 — **Deprecation**
- partner flagged  
- workflows restricted  
- migration or remediation required  
- compatibility fallback provided  

## Stage 4 — **End of Support (EoS)**
- integration disabled  
- access revoked  
- removed from compatibility matrix

# 3. Onboarding Requirements

## Required
- business justification  
- technical overview  
- security overview  
- compliance overview  
- requested tier  
- requested permissions  
- governance approval  

## Forbidden
- unbounded permissions  
- ungoverned workflows  
- direct DB access  

---

# 4. Maintenance Requirements

## Required
- workflow reliability  
- permission review  
- compliance review  
- compatibility updates  

## Optional
- performance improvements  

## Forbidden
- breaking changes  
- new permissions without approval  

---

# 5. Deprecation Rules

## Deprecation Triggers
- repeated workflow failures  
- compliance violations  
- security violations  
- partner instability  
- ecosystem redesign  

## Deprecation Requirements
- public notice  
- migration plan  
- compatibility fallback  
- restricted workflows  

## Deprecation Window
- minimum 6 months  
- recommended 12 months  

---

# 6. End‑of‑Support Rules

## EoS Requirements
- access revoked  
- workflows disabled  
- removal from compatibility matrix  
- removal from partner registry  

## EoS Enforcement
- no updates  
- no guarantees  
- no fallback behavior  

---

# 7. Migration Requirements

## Required
- migration guides  
- compatibility fallback  
- remediation plan (if applicable)  

## Migration Types
- workflow migration  
- permission migration  
- API migration  
- integration migration  

---

# 8. Lifecycle Governance

## Governance Bodies
- TSC: technical lifecycle  
- SCO: security & compliance lifecycle  
- ERC: workflow lifecycle  
- CGB: ecosystem lifecycle  

## Governance Requirements
- annual lifecycle review  
- compatibility matrix update  
- deprecation list update  

---

# 9. Long‑Term Partner Stewardship

## Annual Tasks
- full partner lifecycle review  
- update lifecycle stages  
- publish lifecycle roadmap  
- update compatibility matrix  

## Stewardship Principles
- protect ecosystem integrity  
- maintain partner trust  
- ensure long‑term viability  

---

# 10. Summary

The Partner Lifecycle Specification ensures:
- predictable partner evolution  
- safe deprecations  
- stable integrations  
- clear migration paths  
- strong governance  
- long‑term ecosystem sustainability  

This is the backbone of the KWANUS OS partner lifecycle system.
