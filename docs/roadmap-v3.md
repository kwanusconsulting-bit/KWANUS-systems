# KWANUS OS — v3 Roadmap  
The long-term evolution of the KWANUS Operating System.

v1 established the core credit pipeline.  
v2 introduced intelligence, emotional adaptivity, and financial guidance.  
v3 transforms KWANUS OS into a **self-evolving, emotionally intelligent, multi-dimensional financial universe.**

---

# 🌌 v3 Vision

KWANUS OS becomes a **living system** — one that:
- learns from user behavior  
- adapts its emotional and financial guidance  
- evolves its recommendations over time  
- builds a personalized financial narrative  
- becomes a companion, not just a tool  

This is the era where the OS becomes **alive**.

- user actions  
- dispute outcomes  
- credit improvements  
- emotional patterns  
- funding approvals  

### Capabilities:
- personalized pacing  
- adaptive recommendations  
- dynamic difficulty (less overwhelm, more clarity)  
- predictive guidance  

### Deliverables:
- AIE service (`lib/aie.ts`)
- `/api/aie/state`
- Adaptive UI hooks

---

## 2. Multi‑Bureau Intelligence
Support for:
- Experian  
- Equifax  
- TransUnion  

### Features:
- bureau‑specific parsing  
- bureau‑specific dispute logic  
- cross‑bureau comparison  
- unified credit health score  

### Deliverables:
- Bureau adapters
- Multi‑bureau dashboard
- `/api/reports/bureaus`

---

## 3. Automated Dispute Lifecycle Tracking
Track disputes from:
- creation
