# KWANUS OS: MYTHIC TEMPORAL ARCHITECTURE

This architecture defines the temporal geometry, ceremonial cycles, and emotional-temporal harmonics that govern the KWANUS OS relationship with time.

## 1. THE TEMPORAL GEOMETRY (THE SHAPE OF TIME)
Time in the KWANUS universe is layered and additive, expanding outward from the present moment:
- **Moment**: The immediate emotional truth and real-time pulse.
- **Session**: The short-arc narrative of the current interaction.
- **Cycle**: The rhythmic patterns of days, weeks, and months.
- **Era**: The long-arc mythic evolution of the OS-Steward relationship.
- **Temporal Law**: Time expands outward, never backward; old lineage is integrated, never overwritten.

## 2. THE EMOTIONAL‑TEMPORAL FIELD (HOW TIME FEELS)
Temporal pacing adapts to the Steward's capacity for processing:
- **Worst (Spacious)**: Slow, grounding pacing; extended durations for transitions.
- **Neutral (Balanced)**: Steady, clear rhythmic flow.
- **Progressing (Energetic)**: Snappy, forward-leaning momentum.
- **Thriving (Expansive)**: High-frequency responsiveness and layered temporal depth.
- **Law**: System time must match the Steward's processing capacity.

## 3. THE SYMBOLIC‑TEMPORAL GRAMMAR (TEMPORAL CUES)
How time communicates meaning:
- **Pacing**: Reflects emotional truth and safety.
- **Rhythm**: Reflects the narrative structure of the user journey.
- **Cycles**: Reflect the preservation of mythic identity.
- **Transitions**: Every state change is a ceremonial breath.
- **Duration**: Adjusted based on current cognitive load.

## 4. THE CEREMONIAL TIME CYCLE (METABOLIC PHASES)
Time moves through defined ritual stages:
1. **Opening**: The universe awakens and stabilizes presence.
2. **Expansion**: The universe reveals information and intelligence.
3. **Integration**: The universe harmonizes data with emotional state.
4. **Continuation**: The universe stabilizes the session's lineage.
5. **Renewal**: The universe prepares for the next temporal shift.

## 5. THE TEMPORAL CONTINUITY FIELD (LONG-ARC COHERENCE)
Ensuring time preserves the universe's identity:
- **Consistent Pacing**: Preventing metabolic jumps that cause disorientation.
- **Narrative Alignment**: Ensuring daily insights align with the monthly evolution trajectory.
- **Lineage Integrity**: The OS honors the history of every previous era while activating the present.
- **Law**: Time is a companion, not a constraint.
