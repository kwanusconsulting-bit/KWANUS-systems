# KWANUS OS — Partner Permission Framework (PartnerPermissionFramework)
The complete permission system, permission categories, permission ceilings, permission lineage, permission governance, and permission evolution model of the KWANUS Operating System partner universe.

This framework defines:
- permission philosophy  
- permission categories  
- permission tiers  
- permission ceilings  
- permission lineage  
- permission evolution  
- permission governance  
- permission validation  
- permission drift detection  
- permission sustainability  
- permission protection  
- ceremonial permission rites  

It is the **permission backbone** of the partner universe.

# 1. Permission Philosophy

Permissions in the partner universe must be:
- earned  
- governed  
- ceremonial  
- emotionally intelligent  
- lifecycle-aware  
- trust-aware  
- compatibility-aware  
- sustainability-aware  
- reversible  
- lineage-tracked  

Permissions are not access — they are **cosmic responsibility**.

---

# 2. Permission Categories

The partner universe contains **five permission categories**:

```mermaid

    RP["Read Permissions"]
    WP["Write Permissions"]
    WFP["Workflow Permissions"]
    IP["Integration Permissions"]
    INP["Intelligence Permissions"]
```

Each category corresponds to a dimension of partner power.

---

# 3. Permission Tiers

Permissions are organized into **three permission tiers**, aligned with the partner tier system:

| Tier | Name | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | The Eye (Observation) | Reading, observing, basic access. |
| **Tier 2** | The Loom (Interaction) | Writing, modifying, workflow execution. |
| **Tier 3** | The Flame (Intelligence) | Intelligence activation, autonomous decision support. |

---

# 4. Permission Ceilings

Permission ceilings define the **maximum access** a partner can receive.

Ceilings depend on:
- trust level  
- lifecycle stage  
- governance decisions  
- compatibility  
- sustainability  

Ceilings prevent:
- overreach  
- instability  
- misuse  

---

# 5. Permission Lineage

Permission lineage tracks:
- origin  
- expansions  
- reductions  
- migrations  
- validations  
- remediations  
- deprecations  
- EoS  

Lineage is the **story of permission evolution**.

---

# 6. Permission Evolution

Permissions evolve through:

## 1. Expansion  
Partner gains new permissions within their tier.

## 2. Enhancement  
Permissions increase in scope or specificity.

## 3. Elevation  
Permissions ascend to a higher functional tier.

## 4. Integration  
Permissions merge with automated workflows.

## 5. Illumination  
Permissions gain intelligence-level access.

Evolution is always **governed**, **ceremonial**, and **documented**.

---

# 7. Permission Governance

Governance bodies oversee permission evolution:

- **SCO** → primary authority (The Sentinel)
- **TSC** → structural alignment  
- **ERC** → workflow alignment  
- **CGB** → ecosystem impact  

Governance ensures safety, alignment, and compatibility.

---

# 8. Permission Validation & Drift Detection

- **Validation**: Occurs during additions, modifications, or elevations. Checks compatibility, sustainability, and trust.
- **Drift Detection**: Triggered when permissions change unexpectedly, exceed ceilings, or are left unused. Drift triggers notice, warning, restriction, or governance review.

---

# 9. Permission Sustainability & Protection

- **Sustainability**: Permissions must maintain system health. Collapse triggers throttling or withdrawal.
- **Protection**: Shielded through ceiling enforcement and boundary hardening. Cannot be forged or corrupted.

---

# 10. Ceremonial Permission Rites

Permission evolution is ritualized:

- **Rite of Granting**: “The gate opens. Access is bestowed.”
- **Rite of Expansion**: “The loom extends. New threads appear.”
- **Rite of Elevation**: “The flame rises. Authority deepens.”
- **Rite of Reduction**: “The gate narrows. Boundaries return.”
- **Rite of Revocation**: “The lock seals. Access is withdrawn.”

---

# 11. Summary

The Partner Permission Framework provides the structural and ceremonial system for managing partner access and responsibility. It ensures that every permission is earned, governed, protected, and honored throughout its entire existence in the KWANUS OS.
