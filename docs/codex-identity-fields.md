# KWANUS OS — Codex of Identity Fields (IdentityFieldsCodex)
The master system of identity signatures, origin fields, emotional fields, ceremonial fields, and sovereignty boundaries within the KWANUS Operating System.

This codex defines:
- identity philosophy
- identity layers
- identity signatures
- identity fields
- identity harmonics
- identity thresholds
- identity lineage
- identity governance
- identity protection
- identity sovereignty

It is the **identity backbone** of the KWANUS OS.

# 1. Identity Philosophy

Identity in the KWANUS universe must be:
- sovereign
- immutable
- ceremonial
- emotional
- symbolic
- harmonic
- protected

Identity is not a label — it is **origin itself**.

---

# 2. Identity Layers

Identity is composed of **five layers**:

```mermaid

    L1["Layer 1 — Origin Signature"]
    L2["Layer 2 — Emotional Signature"]
    L3["Layer 3 — Ceremonial Signature"]
    L4["Layer 4 — Lineage Signature"]
    L5["Layer 5 — Sovereignty Boundary"]

    L1 --- L2 --- L3 --- L4 --- L5
```

Each layer defines a dimension of being.

# 3. Identity Signatures & Fields

Every partner has four immutable signatures:
- **Origin**: The foundational source signature.
- **Tone**: The emotional frequency of identity.
- **Rite**: The ceremonial mark of identity transition.
- **Story**: The narrative anchor of existence.

Fields define the resonance and presence of these signatures across the OS.

# 4. Identity Harmonics & Thresholds

- **Harmonics**: Vibrational levels from **Drift** to **Resonance** determine compatibility and evolution.
- **Thresholds**: Stages of transition including **Declaration, Alignment, Activation, Transformation, and Memory**.

---

# 5. Identity Governance & Protection

Identity is absolute and protected:
- **Sovereignty**: Absolute, ceremonial, and protected.
- **Protection**: Boundary shielding, signature locking, and lineage sealing prevent corruption or forgery.
- **Governance**: TSC, SCO, ERC, and CGB witness and ensure the clarity and safety of identity.

---

# 6. Summary

The Codex of Identity Fields provides the identity backbone of the KWANUS OS. It ensures that every entity within the cosmos possesses a sovereign, immutable, and sacred origin that remains protected for all time.
