# KWANUS OS — Partner Audit Protocol (PartnerAuditSpec)
A complete protocol defining how partner integrations are audited, monitored, evaluated, and remediated within the KWANUS Operating System ecosystem.

This document defines:
- audit types  
- audit frequency  
- audit scope  
- audit tools  
- compliance verification  
- workflow audits  
- permission audits  
- data protection audits  
- violation handling  
- remediation requirements  
- long‑term partner audit governance  

It ensures partner integrations remain safe, compliant, and aligned with KWANUS OS governance.

# 1. Audit Philosophy

Partner audits must be:
- strict  
- transparent  
- enforceable  
- predictable  
- continuous  
- aligned with governance  

Audits ensure:
- partner accountability  
- data protection  
- workflow reliability  
- permission integrity  
- ecosystem stability

# 2. Audit Types

## 1. Technical Audit
- API usage  
- workflow reliability  
- extension behavior  
- runtime compatibility  

## 2. Security Audit
- permission usage  
- sandbox integrity  
- vulnerability scanning  
- unauthorized access attempts  

## 3. Compliance Audit
- data protection  
- retention rules  
- deletion rules  
- audit log completeness  

## 4. Ecosystem Audit
- partner ecosystem health  
- workflow impact  
- compatibility alignment  
- governance alignment  

---

# 3. Audit Frequency

## Quarterly Audits
- technical audit  
- security audit  
- workflow audit  
- permission audit  

## Annual Audits
- full compliance audit  
- partner ecosystem review  
- governance alignment review  

## Continuous Audits
- permission usage monitoring  
- API error monitoring  
- workflow anomaly detection  

---

# 4. Audit Scope

## Core Audit Areas
1. **API Usage**
   - contract adherence  
   - version stability  
   - deprecated API usage  

2. **Permissions**
   - least privilege adherence  
   - permission misuse  
   - unauthorized access attempts  

3. **Workflows**
   - reliability  
   - idempotency  
   - reversibility  
   - error rate  

4. **Data Protection**
   - retention compliance  
   - deletion compliance  
   - no raw data access  

5. **Compliance**
   - audit logs  
   - partner documentation  
   - governance alignment

# 5. Audit Tools

## Automated Tools
- permission scanners  
- API contract validators  
- workflow reliability monitors  
- anomaly detection systems  
- vulnerability scanners  

## Manual Tools
- code review  
- compliance review  
- partner documentation review  
- governance review  

---

# 6. Compliance Verification

## Verification Areas
- data protection  
- retention rules  
- deletion rules  
- permission boundaries  
- workflow compliance  
- API contract adherence  

## Verification Methods
- automated checks  
- manual review  
- audit logs  
- partner attestations  

---

# 7. Workflow Audit Rules

## Required Checks
- workflow reliability  
- workflow idempotency  
- workflow reversibility  
- workflow error rate  
- workflow permission usage  

## High‑Risk Indicators
- repeated failures  
- unauthorized workflow triggers  
- deprecated workflow usage  

---

# 8. Permission Audit Rules

## Required Checks
- permission usage  
- permission justification  
- permission boundaries  
- permission drift  

## High‑Risk Indicators
- excessive permissions  
- permission escalation  
- unauthorized access attempts  

---

# 9. Data Protection Audit Rules

## Required Checks
- retention compliance  
- deletion compliance  
- no raw data access  
- no long‑term storage  

## High‑Risk Indicators
- PII storage  
- unauthorized export  
- external tracking  

---

# 10. Violation Handling

## Violation Levels

### Level 1 — Minor
- deprecated API usage  
- minor permission misuse  
- documentation issues  

Action: warning + remediation

### Level 2 — Moderate
- repeated misuse  
- outdated runtimes  
- non‑compliant workflows  

Action: suspension + remediation

### Level 3 — Severe
- unauthorized data access  
- security violations  
- governance violations  

Action: immediate suspension + audit + remediation

---

# 11. Remediation Requirements

## Required Steps
1. identify root cause  
2. submit remediation plan  
3. implement fixes  
4. pass re‑audit  
5. restore access (if applicable)  

## Remediation Window
- minor: 30 days  
- moderate: 14 days  
- severe: immediate + review  

---

# 12. Long‑Term Partner Audit Governance

## Annual Tasks
- full partner audit  
- governance update  
- compatibility update  
- sustainability review  

## Stewardship Principles
- protect ecosystem integrity  
- maintain partner trust  
- ensure long‑term viability  

---

# 13. Summary

The Partner Audit Protocol ensures:
- strict partner oversight  
- predictable compliance  
- safe data handling
