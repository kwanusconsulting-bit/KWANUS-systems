# KWANUS OS — Partner Capability Framework (PartnerCapabilityFramework)
The complete capability system, capability tiers, capability lineage, capability governance, and capability evolution model of the KWANUS Operating System partner universe.

This framework defines:
- capability philosophy  
- capability categories  
- capability tiers  
- capability ceilings  
- capability lineage  
- capability evolution  
- capability governance  
- capability validation  
- capability compatibility  
- capability sustainability  
- capability protection  
- ceremonial capability rites  

It is the **capability backbone** of the partner universe.

# 1. Capability Philosophy

Capabilities in the partner universe must be:
- earned  
- governed  
- ceremonial  
- emotionally intelligent  
- lifecycle-aware  
- trust-aware  
- compatibility-aware  
- sustainability-aware  
- reversible  
- lineage-tracked  

Capabilities are not tools — they are **cosmic powers** granted through alignment.

---

# 2. Capability Categories

The partner universe contains **five capability categories**:

```mermaid

    CC["Core Capabilities"]
    WC["Workflow Capabilities"]
    IC["Integration Capabilities"]
    INC["Intelligence Capabilities"]
    CRC["Ceremonial Capabilities"]
```

Each category corresponds to a dimension of partner function.

---

# 3. Capability Tiers

Capabilities are organized into **three capability tiers**, aligned with the partner tier system:

| Tier | Name | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | The Eye (Perception) | Observation, reading, basic interaction. |
| **Tier 2** | The Loom (Integration) | Workflow execution, transformation, deeper integration. |
| **Tier 3** | The Flame (Intelligence) | Intelligence, reasoning, autonomous decision support. |

---

# 4. Capability Ceilings

Capability ceilings define the **maximum power** a partner can access.

Ceilings depend on:
- trust level  
- lifecycle stage  
- governance decisions  
- compatibility  
- sustainability  

Ceilings prevent:
- overreach  
- instability  
- misuse  

---

# 5. Capability Lineage

Capability lineage tracks:
- origin  
- expansions  
- evolutions  
- migrations  
- validations  
- remediations  
- deprecations  
- EoS  

Lineage is the **story of capability evolution**.

---

# 6. Capability Evolution

Capabilities evolve through:

## 1. Expansion  
Partner gains new capabilities within their tier.

## 2. Enhancement  
Existing capabilities increase in power or accuracy.

## 3. Elevation  
Capabilities ascend to a higher functional tier (e.g., from Eye to Loom).

## 4. Integration  
Capabilities merge with automated workflows.

## 5. Illumination  
Capabilities gain intelligence runtime support.

Evolution is always **governed**, **ceremonial**, and **documented**.

---

# 7. Capability Governance

Governance bodies oversee capability evolution:

- **TSC** → structural integrity  
- **ERC** → workflow integration  
- **SCO** → permission alignment  
- **CGB** → ecosystem impact  

Governance ensures safety, alignment, and compatibility.

---

# 8. Capability Validation

Validation occurs when capabilities:
- are added or modified  
- evolve or elevate  
- migrate or integrate  
- destabilize or drift  

Validation checks compatibility, sustainability, governance history, and trust.

---

# 9. Capability Compatibility & Sustainability

- **Compatibility**: Capabilities must align with the partner's tier, permissions, and the OS version. Incompatibility triggers fallback or restriction.
- **Sustainability**: Capabilities must maintain ecosystem health. Collapse in sustainability metrics triggers throttling or withdrawal.

---

# 10. Capability Protection

Capabilities are protected through:
- **Capability Shielding**: Throttling and rate-limiting.
- **Ceiling Enforcement**: Hard locks on power access.
- **Boundary Shielding**: Isolation of capability execution runtimes.

Capabilities cannot be forged, overwritten, or corrupted.

---

# 11. Ceremonial Capability Rites

Capability evolution is ritualized:

- **Rite of Expansion**: “The loom unfolds. New threads appear.”
- **Rite of Enhancement**: “The pattern strengthens. Power deepens.”
- **Rite of Elevation**: “The flame rises. Intelligence awakens.”
- **Rite of Integration**: “The threads merge. Harmony forms.”
- **Rite of Illumination**: “The inner light brightens. Insight emerges.”

---

# 12. Summary

The Partner Capability Framework provides the structural and ceremonial system for managing partner power. It ensures that every capability is earned, governed, protected, and honored throughout its entire existence in the KWANUS OS.
