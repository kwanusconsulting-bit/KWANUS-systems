# KWANUS OS — Partner Deprecation Protocol (PartnerDeprecationSpec)
A complete protocol defining how partners, capabilities, workflows, and permissions are deprecated safely, predictably, and sustainably within the KWANUS Operating System ecosystem.

This document defines:
- deprecation triggers  
- deprecation workflow  
- deprecation windows  
- compatibility requirements  
- fallback behavior  
- communication rules  
- migration requirements  
- validation rules  
- EoS rules  
- long‑term deprecation governance  

It ensures deprecations are safe, predictable, and aligned with KWANUS OS governance.

# 1. Deprecation Philosophy

Deprecation must be:
- predictable  
- governed  
- reversible (during window)  
- compatible  
- sustainable  
- long‑term oriented  

Deprecation ensures:
- ecosystem stability  
- partner accountability  
- safe evolution  
- workflow continuity  

---

# 2. Deprecation Triggers

## Required Deprecation Triggers
- repeated workflow failures  
- repeated permission misuse  
- compliance violations  
- security violations  
- partner instability  
- deprecated APIs  
- deprecated runtimes  

## Optional Deprecation Triggers
- ecosystem redesign  
- partner tier downgrade  
- capability restructuring  

## Forced Deprecation Triggers
- severe violations  
- unauthorized data access  
- governance violations

# 3. Deprecation Workflow Overview

## Step 1 — Deprecation Notice
- partner notified  
- deprecation reason provided  
- deprecation window defined  
- fallback behavior activated  

## Step 2 — Deprecation Plan
Partner must submit:
- migration plan  
- compatibility plan  
- testing plan  
- rollback plan  

## Step 3 — Restriction Phase
- workflows restricted  
- permissions reduced  
- capabilities limited  

## Step 4 — Migration Phase
- partner migrates  
- OS provides fallback  
- OS provides migration guides  

## Step 5 — Validation Phase
- compatibility validation  
- workflow validation  
- permission validation  
- compliance validation  

## Step 6 — EoS Phase
- fallback removed  
- access revoked  
- partner removed from registry

# 4. Deprecation Windows

## Required Windows
- minimum 6 months  
- recommended 12 months  

## Shortened Windows (allowed only for severe violations)
- 30 days  
- 7 days (critical security)  
- immediate (catastrophic)  

## Forbidden
- silent deprecations  
- unannounced deprecations  
- retroactive deprecations  

---

# 5. Compatibility Requirements

## Required
- compatibility matrix update  
- fallback behavior  
- migration guides  
- versioned rollout  

## Forbidden
- silent breaking changes  
- runtime fragmentation  
- permission expansion during deprecation  

---

# 6. Fallback Behavior

## Required
- fallback APIs  
- fallback workflows  
- fallback permissions (read‑only)  

## Fallback Duration
- lasts entire deprecation window  
- removed at EoS  

## Forbidden
- fallback that bypasses governance  
- fallback that expands permissions  

---

# 7. Communication Rules

## Required
- deprecation announcement  
- migration guides  
- compatibility notes  
- EoS timeline  

## Optional
- partner‑specific support  
- developer tutorials  

## Forbidden
- silent changes  
- undocumented changes  

---

# 8. Migration Requirements

## Required
- migration plan  
- compatibility fallback  
- remediation plan (if applicable)  

## Migration Types
- API migration  
- workflow migration  
- permission migration  
- runtime migration  
- tier migration  

---

# 9. Validation Rules

## Required Validation
- API contract validation  
- workflow validation  
- permission boundary validation  
- runtime compatibility validation  

## Forbidden
- unbounded permissions  
- ungoverned workflows  
- incompatible runtimes  

---

# 10. End‑of‑Support (EoS) Rules

## Required
- access revoked  
- workflows disabled  
- permissions removed  
- partner removed from registry  
- compatibility matrix updated  

## Forbidden
- partial EoS  
- silent EoS  
- fallback after EoS  

---

# 11. Long‑Term Deprecation Governance

## Annual Tasks
- deprecation review  
- compatibility update  
- lifecycle update  
- sustainability review  

## Governance Bodies
- TSC (technical)  
- SCO (security & compliance)  
- ERC (workflow)  
- CGB (ecosystem)

# 12. Summary

The Partner Deprecation Protocol ensures:
- safe partner deprecations  
- predictable evolution  
- stable workflows  
- strong governance  
- long‑term ecosystem integrity  

This is the backbone of the KWANUS OS partner deprecation system.
