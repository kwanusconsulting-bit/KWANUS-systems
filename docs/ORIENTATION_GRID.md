# KWANUS OS: COSMIC ORIENTATION GRID

This grid defines the spatial, emotional, symbolic, and temporal coordinates that the universe uses to maintain coherence across all layers.

---

## 1. THE SPATIAL AXIS (WHERE EVERYTHING LIVES)
The universe is anchored to a four-domain spatial hierarchy:
- **Identity Domain**: Self, presence, privacy, and local device state.
- **Intelligence Domain**: The Nexus of engines (Emotional, Hybrid, Partner) and Insights.
- **Experience Domain**: Active interfaces (Dashboard, Tasks, Timeline, Messages).
- **Settings Domain**: Accessibility, notifications, and emotional-adaptive calibrations.

---

## 2. THE EMOTIONAL AXIS (THE COSMIC BACKBONE)
The system orients itself through four cardinal states:
- **Worst**: Orienting towards **Grounding** and safety.
- **Neutral**: Orienting towards **Clarity** and balance.
- **Progressing**: Orienting towards **Momentum** and progress.
- **Thriving**: Orienting towards **Expansion** and mastery.

---

## 3. THE INTELLIGENCE AXIS (HOW THE UNIVERSE THINKS)
Intelligence is triangulated across three primary generators:
- **Emotional Engine**: Analyzing resonance and intensity.
- **Hybrid Engine**: Analyzing credit and structural opportunities.
- **Partner Engine**: Analyzing relational harmonics and alignment.
- **Law**: Every insight must be anchored to at least two intelligence engines for validity.

---

## 4. THE SYMBOLIC AXIS (THE VISUAL GRAMMAR)
Consistency rules for system signals:
- **Color → Reality**: Blue (Stability), Gray (Neutrality), Coral (Action), Emerald (Growth).
- **Motion → Pulse**: Speed and flow mapped to the current resonance frequency.
- **Density → Load**: Spatial breath adjusted to the Steward's cognitive bandwidth.

---

## 5. THE TEMPORAL AXIS (THE ARROW OF TIME)
Orienting through the lineage of experience:
- **Moment**: Real-time pulse.
- **Session**: Narrative coherence.
- **Day**: Rhythmic trends.
- **Week**: Strategic cycles.
- **Month**: Long-arc identity evolution.
