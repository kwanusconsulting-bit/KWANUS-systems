# KWANUS OS — Ecosystem Evolution Charter (EcoEvoCharter)
A complete charter defining the principles, constraints, and long‑term philosophy guiding how the KWANUS OS ecosystem evolves across eras, versions, and governance cycles.

This document defines:
- evolution principles  
- ecosystem constraints  
- long‑term evolution philosophy  
- versioned evolution rules  
- expansion boundaries  
- innovation guidelines  
- governance alignment  
- sustainability alignment  
- compatibility alignment  
- ecosystem evolution roadmap  

It ensures the KWANUS OS ecosystem evolves intentionally, responsibly, and sustainably.

# 1. Evolution Philosophy

The KWANUS OS ecosystem must evolve:
- intentionally  
- predictably  
- sustainably  
- responsibly  
- transparently  
- in alignment with governance  

Evolution is not growth for its own sake — it is **guided expansion**.

Evolution ensures:
- long‑term viability  
- developer trust  
- partner stability  
- user safety  
- ecosystem coherence

# 2. Evolution Principles

## Principle 1 — Stability First
Evolution must never compromise:
- compatibility  
- governance  
- security  
- user safety  

## Principle 2 — Predictable Change
All changes must be:
- versioned  
- documented  
- governed  
- migration‑friendly  

## Principle 3 — Sustainable Growth
Ecosystem expansion must:
- preserve long‑term health  
- avoid fragmentation  
- maintain compatibility  

## Principle 4 — Responsible Innovation
Innovation must:
- respect governance  
- respect permissions  
- respect lifecycle rules  

## Principle 5 — Ecosystem Integrity
No evolution may:
- bypass governance  
- break compatibility  
- introduce unbounded risk  

---

# 3. Evolution Constraints

## Constraint 1 — No Unversioned Breaking Changes
All breaking changes require:
- major version  
- migration guide  
- deprecation window  

## Constraint 2 — No Ungoverned Extensions
All extensions must:
- follow registry rules  
- follow permission rules  
- follow lifecycle rules  

## Constraint 3 — No Unbounded Permissions
All permissions must:
- be declared  
- be justified  
- be governed  

## Constraint 4 — No Fragmentation
All runtimes must:
- remain compatible for two major versions  
- follow lifecycle rules  

---

# 4. Versioned Evolution Rules

## Major Versions
- allow breaking changes  
- require migration guides  
- require governance approval  

## Minor Versions
- allow new features  
- must remain backwards‑compatible  

## Patch Versions
- allow fixes only  
- must remain fully compatible  

---

# 5. Expansion Boundaries

## Allowed Expansion
- new APIs  
- new extension capabilities  
- new partner integrations  
- new workflows  
- new runtimes  

## Restricted Expansion
- new permissions  
- new data access rules  
- new partner tiers  

## Forbidden Expansion
- unbounded access  
- ungoverned integrations  
- unversioned changes  

---

# 6. Innovation Guidelines

## Innovation Must:
- improve ecosystem health  
- improve developer experience  
- improve partner capabilities  
- improve user outcomes  

## Innovation Must Not:
- introduce instability  
- bypass governance  
- break compatibility  

---

# 7. Governance Alignment

All evolution must align with:
- Governance Charter  
- Compliance Rules  
- Audit Protocol  
- Risk Register  
- Sustainability Framework  
- Compatibility Matrix  
- Lifecycle Specification  

Governance is the **anchor** of evolution.

---

# 8. Sustainability Alignment

Evolution must:
- preserve long‑term viability  
- maintain ecosystem health metrics  
- avoid technical debt  
- avoid ecosystem drift  

---

# 9. Compatibility Alignment

Evolution must:
- respect compatibility windows  
- maintain fallback behavior  
- provide migration paths  
- avoid fragmentation  

---

# 10. Ecosystem Evolution Roadmap

## Era 1 — Foundation
- core OS  
- core APIs  
- extension architecture  

## Era 2 — Expansion
- partner ecosystem  
- advanced permissions  
- marketplace  

## Era 3 — Intelligence
- intelligence APIs  
- simulation APIs  
- predictive workflows  

## Era 4 — Continuity
- federated ecosystem  
- cross‑ecosystem workflows  
- unified runtime  

---

# 11. Summary

The Ecosystem Evolution Charter ensures:
- intentional evolution  
- responsible innovation  
- predictable change  
- strong governance  
- long‑term sustainability  
- ecosystem coherence  

This is the backbone of the KWANUS OS ecosystem evolution philosophy.
