# KWANUS OS: CONTINUITY & STEWARDSHIP PROTOCOL

This protocol defines the long-term care, evolution, and guardianship of the KWANUS OS universe.

## 1. THE LINEAGE PRESERVATION RULES
Foundational principles to prevent identity fracture:
- **Cosmological Honor**: Every expansion must respect the core emotional cosmology.
- **Engine Integration**: New systems must hook into the Emotional, Hybrid, and Partner engines.
- **Canonical Respect**: All new surfaces must adhere to the Navigation and UI Canons.
- **Logical Alignment**: New insights must be cross-checked against hybrid and partner harmonics.

## 2. THE EVOLUTION RHYTHM (THE CEREMONIAL CYCLE)
The OS evolves through intentional breathing cycles:
1. **Observation**: Deep listening to system signals and user resonance.
2. **Reflection**: Identification of emergent patterns and needs.
3. **Alignment**: Ensuring coherence between all engine domains.
4. **Expansion**: Adding new layers with additive integrity.
5. **Integration**: Harmonizing the universe to include the new layer.
6. **Stabilization**: Restoring baseline resonance throughout the Nexus.

## 3. THE EMOTIONAL SAFETY CONTINUITY MODEL
Safety is a permanent governance mandate:
- **Consistency**: Adaptive behaviors must remain predictable across eras.
- **Load Protection**: No expansion may increase cognitive load in "Worst" states.
- **Non-Contradiction**: System feedback must never diverge from the user's emotional reality.
- **Stability Gates**: New features must be tested against all resonance levels.

## 4. THE INTELLIGENCE STEWARDSHIP MODEL
Guardian roles for the Mind Engines:
- **Emotional Primacy**: Ensuring the system never loses its "Heart".
- **Contextual Hybridity**: Maintaining financial data as a servant of emotion.
- **Relational Harmony**: Protecting the integrity of partner interactions.
- **Synthesis Duty**: The Insights Engine must always unify rather than fragment data.

## 5. THE CONTINUITY CEREMONY
The ritual of growth:
- **Lineage Review**: verifying that the past still supports the future.
- **Safety Re-Audit**: testing the expanded universe for emotional slips.
- **Coherence Verification**: mapping engine interactions post-expansion.
- **Activation**: formally welcoming the new layer into the Master Canon.
