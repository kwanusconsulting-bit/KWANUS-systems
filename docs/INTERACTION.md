# KWANUS OS: UNIVERSE-WIDE INTERACTION MODEL

This model defines the interaction grammar of the KWANUS OS—shaping every user action and system reaction.

---

## 1. THE INPUT MODEL (HOW USERS INITIATE)
Every gesture and click is modulated by emotional-adaptive rules:
- **Worst**: Large, stable targets. Slower, deliberate response times. Reduced gesture complexity.
- **Neutral**: Standard responsiveness. Balanced touch/click affordances.
- **Progressing**: Increased snappiness. More interactive hover-states and micro-cues.
- **Thriving**: High-frequency responsiveness. Multi-layered gestures and insight-triggering micro-interactions.

---

## 2. THE RESPONSE MODEL (HOW THE OS REACTS)
A consistent four-stage reaction pattern:
1. **Acknowledge**: Immediate visual/kinetic feedback (The system "hears" you).
2. **Process**: Background intelligence engines update resonance and scores.
3. **Adapt**: The UI atmosphere shifts (color, density, motion).
4. **Reveal**: Surfacing the next logical step or speculative insight.

## 3. THE TRANSITION MODEL (HOW THE OS MOVES)
State-switching is a ceremonial movement:
- **Worst**: Minimal motion. Grounding "fade-to-focus" transitions.
- **Neutral**: Smooth, rhythmic "slide-and-settle" kinetics.
- **Progressing**: Directional, energetic "leap" animations.
- **Thriving**: Expressive, multi-layer parallax and "depth-reveal" motion.

---

## 4. THE FEEDBACK MODEL (HOW THE OS SPEAKS)
Feedback must always be:
- **Clear**: No ambiguous state representations.
- **Attuned**: Linguistic tone matches the current intensity.
- **Non-Overwhelming**: Information delivery paced by current cognitive load.
- **Continuous**: Preserving the narrative thread of the interaction.

---

## 5. THE CONTINUITY MODEL (UNBREAKABLE INTERACTION)
Every interaction honors the lineage:
- **No Abrupt Context Loss**: Transitions must preserve spatial grounding.
- **No Emotional Contradiction**: A successful action must never trigger a "negative" visual cue if the engine is thriving.
- **No Dead Ends**: Every interaction leads to a growth or grounding path.
- **Spatial Memory**: The OS "remembers" where the user came from during deep navigation.
