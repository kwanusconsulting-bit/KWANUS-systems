# KWANUS Ceremonial Readiness Cycle

Before any system consolidation, the OS passes through this integrity gate.

## 1. Integrity Suite Baseline
- [ ] **Unit Domain**: 100% pass on Emotional, Hybrid, and Partner logic.
- [ ] **Integration Domain**: Verified event resonance across all 8 MIA surfaces.
- [ ] **Security Domain**: Zero leakage of server-sovereign intelligence to client bundles.

## 2. Emotional Safety Audit
- [ ] **Tone Check**: Voice modulation correctly softens in 'Worst' mode.
- [ ] **Pacing Check**: Background tasks defer during low-resonance periods.
- [ ] **Accessibility Check**: Motion sensitivity respects reduced-motion preferences.

## 3. Resilience Review
- [ ] **Offline Stability**: Local-only tasks operate without data loss.
- [ ] **Handoff Continuity**: Session state persists across mock device shifts.

## 4. Final Blessing
A successful Readiness Cycle culminates in a **System Consolidation**, locking the blueprints and graduating to Full Implementation.
