# KWANUS OS: EXPERIENCE INTEGRITY RULES

These rules define the non-negotiable quality principles that govern the user experience across the entire KWANUS universe.

---

## 1. THE CLARITY RULES (KWANUS MUST ALWAYS BE CLEAR)
Users must never be lost in the Nexus:
- **Spatial Awareness**: Current location must be explicitly indicated.
- **Action Clarity**: Every button and link must have a discernible emotional and functional impact.
- **Insight Truth**: No recommendations are surfaced without clear data lineage.
- **Failure Grace**: Error states must be grounding rather than disruptive.

---

## 2. THE EMOTIONAL SAFETY RULES (KWANUS MUST NEVER HARM)
The system's prime directive is emotional protection:
- **Density Gating**: No overwhelming layouts in "Worst" intensity.
- **Insight Gating**: Predictive insights are suppressed during instability.
- **Transition Smoothness**: Zero abrupt motion shifts; transitions must feel like breathing.
- **Linguistic Care**: Tone must shift from "Direct" to "Gentle" as intensity decreases.

## 3. THE INTELLIGENCE CONSISTENCY RULES (KWANUS MUST ALWAYS ALIGN)
Preventing cross-engine contradictions:
- **Primacy**: The Emotional Engine is the source of truth for UI state.
- **Harmonic Check**: Hybrid outcomes must be weighed against relational harmonics before appearing on the Dashboard.
- **Notification Pacing**: Rhythmic signaling that respects the user's current pace.

---

## 4. THE NAVIGATION COHERENCE RULES (KWANUS MUST ALWAYS FLOW)
Ensuring movement is a form of guidance:
- **Radial Accessibility**: Critical tools are always 1 leap away from the center.
- **No Orphan Surfaces**: Every page must belong to a parent domain.
- **Continuity Paths**: Every deep flow has a clear path back to the grounding center.

---

## 5. THE CONTINUITY RULES (KWANUS MUST NEVER BREAK)
Protecting the lineage of the build:
- **Additive Expansion**: We build up, never over.
- **Zero Regression**: Performance and A11y scores must never drop.
- **Identity Sovereignty**: User data and profile integrity are protected at the server boundary.
- **Relational Memory**: Partner harmonics must be preserved with historical accuracy.
