# KWANUS OS — Ecosystem Sustainability Framework (EcoSustainSpec)
A complete framework defining ecosystem health metrics, sustainability rules, lifecycle management, and long‑term viability protocols for the KWANUS Operating System.

This document defines:
- ecosystem health metrics  
- sustainability rules  
- lifecycle management  
- extension ecosystem viability  
- partner ecosystem viability  
- compatibility sustainability  
- governance sustainability  
- risk mitigation  
- long‑term ecosystem stewardship  

It ensures the KWANUS OS ecosystem remains healthy, stable, and sustainable across eras.

# 1. Sustainability Philosophy

The KWANUS OS ecosystem must be:
- healthy  
- resilient  
- predictable  
- governed  
- long‑term oriented  
- self‑sustaining  

Sustainability ensures:
- ecosystem longevity  
- developer trust  
- partner stability  
- user safety  
- predictable evolution

# 2. Ecosystem Health Metrics

## Core Metrics
1. **Extension Health**
   - adoption  
   - reliability  
   - update frequency  
   - permission usage  

2. **API Health**
   - stability  
   - latency  
   - error rate  
   - deprecation load  

3. **Compatibility Health**
   - cross‑version compatibility  
   - fallback usage  
   - migration success rate  

4. **Security Health**
   - vulnerabilities  
   - permission violations  
   - audit findings  

5. **Partner Health**
   - integration uptime  
   - workflow reliability  
   - compliance alignment  

---

# 3. Sustainability Rules

## Required
- versioned governance  
- compatibility windows  
- deprecation cycles  
- annual ecosystem audits  
- quarterly health reports  

## Recommended
- partner ecosystem reviews  
- extension ecosystem reviews  
- API contract reviews  

## Forbidden
- unversioned breaking changes  
- ungoverned extensions  
- unbounded permissions  

---

# 4. Lifecycle Management

## Lifecycle Stages
1. **Active**
   - full support  
   - new features allowed  

2. **Maintenance**
   - bug fixes  
   - security patches  

3. **Deprecation**
   - warnings issued  
   - migration guides required  

4. **End of Support**
   - no updates  
   - removal from compatibility matrix  

## Lifecycle Requirements
- every API must have a lifecycle stage  
- every extension runtime must have a lifecycle stage  
- every permission must have a lifecycle stage  

---

# 5. Extension Ecosystem Sustainability

## Extension Viability Metrics
- update frequency  
- compatibility adherence  
- permission usage  
- error rate  
- adoption  

## Extension Sustainability Rules
- extensions must update within compatibility windows  
- deprecated runtimes must migrate within one major version  
- high‑risk extensions require quarterly review  

---

# 6. Partner Ecosystem Sustainability

## Partner Viability Metrics
- uptime  
- workflow reliability  
- compliance alignment  
- API usage patterns  

## Partner Sustainability Rules
- partners must maintain compatibility  
- partners must pass annual compliance review  
- partners must adhere to permission boundaries  

---

# 7. Compatibility Sustainability

## Compatibility Requirements
- stable APIs must remain stable  
- deprecated APIs must remain supported for one major version  
- extension runtimes must remain compatible for two major versions  

## Compatibility Health Indicators
- fallback usage  
- migration success rate  
- deprecated API usage  

---

# 8. Governance Sustainability

## Governance Health Metrics
- policy update frequency  
- audit findings  
- compliance violations  
- governance drift  

## Governance Sustainability Rules
- annual governance review  
- compatibility matrix updates  
- policy updates as needed  

---

# 9. Risk Mitigation

## Risk Categories
- technical risk  
- security risk  
- compliance risk  
- ecosystem risk  

## Mitigation Strategies
- early detection  
- compatibility fallbacks  
- automated audits  
- partner reviews  
- extension sandboxing  

---

# 10. Long‑Term Ecosystem Stewardship

## Annual Tasks
- full ecosystem audit  
- compatibility matrix update  
- governance update  
- sustainability report  

## Stewardship Principles
- protect ecosystem integrity  
- maintain developer trust  
- ensure long‑term viability  
- preserve compatibility continuity  

---

# 11. Summary

The Ecosystem Sustainability Framework ensures:
- long‑term ecosystem health  
- predictable evolution  
- safe extension growth  
- stable partner integrations  
- strong governance  
- sustainable compatibility  

This is the backbone of the KWANUS OS ecosystem sustainability system.
