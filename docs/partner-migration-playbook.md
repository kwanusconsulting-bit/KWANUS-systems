# KWANUS OS — Partner Migration Playbook (PartnerMigrationPlaybook)
A complete playbook defining how partners migrate across versions, tiers, runtimes, workflows, and permissions within the KWANUS Operating System ecosystem.

This document defines:
- migration triggers  
- migration types  
- migration workflow  
- compatibility requirements  
- fallback behavior  
- documentation requirements  
- validation rules  
- remediation rules  
- long‑term migration governance  

It ensures partner migrations are safe, predictable, and aligned with KWANUS OS governance.

# 1. Migration Philosophy

Partner migration must be:
- predictable  
- governed  
- reversible  
- compatible  
- sustainable  
- long‑term oriented  

Migration ensures:
- stable workflows  
- safe evolution  
- partner accountability  
- ecosystem continuity  

---

# 2. Migration Triggers

## Required Migration Triggers
- major OS version changes  
- API deprecations  
- workflow deprecations  
- permission changes  
- runtime changes  

## Optional Migration Triggers
- tier upgrades  
- tier downgrades  
- capability expansion  

## Forced Migration Triggers
- compliance violations  
- security violations  
- partner instability  

---

# 3. Migration Types

## 1. Version Migration
- OS version migration  
- API version migration  
- workflow version migration  

## 2. Tier Migration
- tier upgrades  
- tier downgrades  

## 3. Runtime Migration
- extension runtime migration  
- workflow runtime migration  
- intelligence runtime migration  

## 4. Permission Migration
- permission reduction  
- permission expansion (governed)  
- permission restructuring  

## 5. Workflow Migration
- workflow trigger migration  
- workflow handler migration  
- workflow permission migration  

---

# 4. Migration Workflow Overview

## Step 1 — Migration Notice
- partner notified  
- migration window defined  
- fallback behavior activated  

## Step 2 — Migration Plan
Partner must submit:
- migration strategy  
- compatibility plan  
- testing plan  
- rollback plan  

## Step 3 — Implementation
- development  
- testing  
- documentation  

## Step 4 — Validation
- compatibility validation  
- security validation  
- workflow validation  
- permission validation  

## Step 5 — Rollout
- versioned release  
- fallback behavior maintained  

## Step 6 — Monitoring
- workflow reliability  
- permission usage  
- API error rates  

## Step 7 — Completion
- fallback removed  
- migration marked complete  
- lifecycle updated

# 5. Compatibility Requirements

## Required
- compatibility matrix alignment  
- fallback behavior  
- migration guides  
- versioned rollout  

## Forbidden
- silent breaking changes  
- unversioned changes  
- runtime fragmentation  

---

# 6. Fallback Behavior

## Required
- fallback APIs  
- fallback workflows  
- fallback permissions (read‑only)  

## Fallback Duration
- minimum 6 months  
- recommended 12 months  

## Forbidden
- fallback that expands permissions  
- fallback that bypasses governance  

---

# 7. Documentation Requirements

## Required Documentation
- migration guide  
- compatibility notes  
- version notes  
- workflow changes  
- permission changes  

## Optional Documentation
- developer tutorials  
- partner onboarding guides  

---

# 8. Validation Rules

## Required Validation
- API contract validation  
- workflow validation  
- permission boundary validation  
- runtime compatibility validation  

## Forbidden
- unbounded permissions  
- ungoverned workflows  
- incompatible runtimes  

---

# 9. Remediation Rules

## Required Steps
1. identify root cause  
2. submit remediation plan  
3. implement fixes  
4. pass re‑validation  
5. restore full access  

## Remediation Window
- minor: 30 days  
- moderate: 14 days  
- severe: immediate + review  

---

# 10. Long‑Term Migration Governance

## Annual Tasks
- migration review  
- compatibility update  
- lifecycle update  
- sustainability review  

## Governance Bodies
- TSC (technical)  
- SCO (security & compliance)  
- ERC (workflow)  
- CGB (ecosystem)

# 11. Summary

The Partner Migration Playbook ensures:
- safe partner migrations  
- predictable evolution  
- stable workflows  
- strong governance  
- long‑term ecosystem integrity  

This is the backbone of the KWANUS OS partner migration system.
