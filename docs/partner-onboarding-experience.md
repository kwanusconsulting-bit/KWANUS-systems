# 1. Onboarding Philosophy

Onboarding in the partner universe must be:
- gentle  
- ceremonial  
- emotionally intelligent  
- grounding  
- mythic‑modern  
- governance‑aligned  
- lifecycle‑aware  
- trust‑aware  
- compatibility‑aware  
- protective  

Onboarding is not orientation — it is **cosmic arrival**.

# 2. Onboarding Stages

The onboarding experience contains **six stages**:
