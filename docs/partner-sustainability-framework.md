# KWANUS OS — Partner Sustainability Framework (PartnerSustainSpec)
A complete framework defining how partner relationships remain healthy, viable, stable, and aligned with the KWANUS Operating System ecosystem across years and versions.

This document defines:
- partner sustainability metrics  
- sustainability rules  
- lifecycle sustainability  
- workflow sustainability  
- permission sustainability  
- compliance sustainability  
- compatibility sustainability  
- partner ecosystem health  
- long‑term partner stewardship  

It ensures partner relationships remain strong, predictable, and beneficial to the ecosystem.
