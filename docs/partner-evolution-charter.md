# KWANUS OS — Partner Evolution Charter (PartnerEvoCharter)
A complete charter defining the principles, constraints, and long‑term philosophy guiding how partner relationships evolve across eras within the KWANUS Operating System ecosystem.

This document defines:
- partner evolution principles  
- evolution constraints  
- long‑term partnership philosophy  
- tier evolution rules  
- capability evolution rules  
- governance alignment  
- sustainability alignment  
- compatibility alignment  
- partner evolution roadmap  

It ensures partner relationships evolve intentionally, responsibly, and sustainably.

# 1. Evolution Philosophy

Partner evolution must be:
- intentional  
- governed  
- predictable  
- sustainable  
- secure  
- aligned with ecosystem integrity  

Evolution is not expansion for its own sake — it is **guided relational growth**.

Evolution ensures:
- long‑term partner stability  
- workflow reliability  
- ecosystem coherence  
- user safety

# 2. Partner Evolution Principles

## Principle 1 — Governance First
Partner evolution must never compromise:
- governance  
- compliance  
- security  
- compatibility  

## Principle 2 — Predictable Growth
All partner capability changes must be:
- versioned  
- documented  
- governed  
- migration‑friendly  

## Principle 3 — Sustainable Partnership
Partner evolution must:
- preserve long‑term viability  
- avoid ecosystem drift  
- maintain compatibility  

## Principle 4 — Responsible Empowerment
Partner capabilities must:
- respect permission boundaries  
- respect lifecycle rules  
- respect data protection rules  

## Principle 5 — Ecosystem Integrity
No partner evolution may:
- bypass governance  
- introduce unbounded risk  
- destabilize workflows  

---

# 3. Evolution Constraints

## Constraint 1 — No Unbounded Permissions
All permissions must be:
- declared  
- justified  
- governed  

## Constraint 2 — No Ungoverned Workflows
All workflows must:
- be versioned  
- be auditable  
- be reversible  

## Constraint 3 — No Fragmentation
All partner integrations must:
- remain compatible  
- follow lifecycle rules  

## Constraint 4 — No Silent Capability Expansion
All capability changes require:
- governance approval  
- documentation  
- migration plan (if applicable)  

---

# 4. Tier Evolution Rules

## Tier 1 → Tier 2
Allowed only if:
- workflows are reliable  
- compliance is clean  
- permissions are minimal  
- risk is low  

## Tier 2 → Tier 3
Allowed only if:
- partner passes full governance review  
- partner passes security review  
- partner passes compliance review  
- partner demonstrates long‑term stability  

## Tier Downgrades
Triggered by:
- compliance violations  
- workflow failures  
- permission misuse  
- partner instability  

---

# 5. Capability Evolution Rules

## Allowed
- new read‑only capabilities  
- new workflow triggers  
- new partner UI components  

## Restricted
- new write operations  
- new advanced permissions  
- new intelligence workflows  

## Forbidden
- global UI overrides  
- navigation overrides  
- raw data access  

---

# 6. Governance Alignment

All partner evolution must align with:
- Partner Framework  
- Partner Integration Specification  
- Partner Compliance Specification  
- Partner Audit Protocol  
- Partner Risk Register  
- Ecosystem Governance Charter  
- Compatibility Matrix  
- Lifecycle Specification  

Governance is the **anchor** of partner evolution.

---

# 7. Sustainability Alignment

Partner evolution must:
- preserve long‑term viability  
- maintain ecosystem health  
- avoid technical debt  
- avoid ecosystem drift  

---

# 8. Compatibility Alignment

Partner evolution must:
- respect compatibility windows  
- maintain fallback behavior  
- provide migration paths  
- avoid fragmentation  

---

# 9. Partner Evolution Roadmap

## Era 1 — Foundation
- partner onboarding  
- basic workflows  
- read‑only access  

## Era 2 — Expansion
- workflow partners  
- advanced permissions  
- partner UI components  

## Era 3 — Intelligence
- intelligence partners  
- predictive workflows  
- advanced data governance  

## Era 4 — Continuity
- federated partner ecosystem  
- cross‑ecosystem workflows  
- unified partner runtime  

---

# 10. Summary

The Partner Evolution Charter ensures:
- intentional partner evolution  
- responsible capability expansion  
- predictable change  
- strong governance  
- long‑term sustainability  
- ecosystem coherence  

This is the backbone of the KWANUS OS partner evolution philosophy.
