# KWANUS OS — Partner End‑of‑Support Specification (PartnerEoSSpec)
A complete specification defining the final stage of the partner lifecycle: access removal, workflow shutdown, registry removal, and post‑EoS governance within the KWANUS Operating System ecosystem.

This document defines:
- EoS triggers  
- EoS workflow  
- access removal rules  
- workflow shutdown rules  
- permission removal rules  
- registry removal rules  
- post‑EoS governance  
- data handling rules  
- communication requirements  
- long‑term EoS stewardship  

It ensures partner end‑of‑support is safe, predictable, and aligned with KWANUS OS governance.

# 1. EoS Philosophy

End‑of‑Support must be:
- final  
- governed  
- irreversible  
- secure  
- predictable  
- ecosystem‑aligned  

EoS ensures:
- ecosystem stability  
- partner accountability  
- safe retirement  
- long‑term integrity

# 2. EoS Triggers

## Required EoS Triggers
- completion of deprecation window  
- partner non‑remediation  
- partner instability  
- repeated compliance violations  
- repeated security violations  
- workflow unreliability  
- deprecated runtime or API  

## Optional EoS Triggers
- partner exit  
- ecosystem redesign  
- capability restructuring  

## Forced EoS Triggers
- catastrophic security violations  
- unauthorized data access  
- governance violations

# 3. EoS Workflow Overview

## Step 1 — EoS Notice

- permissions removed  
- workflows disabled  
- runtime access disabled  

## Step 3 — Registry Removal
- partner removed from registry  
- partner metadata archived  
- compatibility matrix updated  

## Step 4 — Data Handling
- temporary data deleted  
- logs sanitized  
- compliance verified  

## Step 5 — Post‑EoS Review
- governance review  
- ecosystem impact review  
- sustainability update
