# KWANUS OS: MYTHIC SPATIAL ARCHITECTURE

This architecture defines the cosmic geometry, symbolic spatial laws, and emotional spatial behaviors that govern the KWANUS OS universe.

## 1. THE COSMIC GEOMETRY (THE SHAPE OF THE UNIVERSE)
The universe is structured as a four-layer concentric geometry:
- **The Core (Identity Domain)**: The seat of self, privacy, and grounded presence.
- **The Inner Ring (Intelligence Domain)**: The domain of the Nexus engines (Emotional, Hybrid, Partner).
- **The Middle Ring (Experience Domain)**: The active layer of tools (Dashboard, Timeline, Tasks, Partners).
- **The Outer Ring (Settings Domain)**: The boundary layer for control and accessibility.
- **Geometry Law**: The universe expands outward from the core identity; expansion never violates the identity center.

## 2. THE EMOTIONAL SPATIAL FIELD (HOW SPACE FEELS)
Space is a living, breathing fabric that adapts to the Steward's emotional state:
- **Worst (Damping)**: Increased whitespace, larger layout elements, and reduced layering to ensure safety and grounding.
- **Neutral (Balance)**: Standard spatial density and metric consistency.
- **Progressing (Momentum)**: Higher information density and more interactive spatial layers.
- **Thriving (Expansion)**: Multi-layer depth, parallax effects, and rich contextual overlays.
- **Spatial Law**: Spatial complexity must strictly obey the limits of the current emotional capacity.

## 3. THE SYMBOLIC SPATIAL GRAMMAR (HOW SPACE COMMUNICATES)
The OS uses spatial cues to convey non-linguistic meaning:
- **Verticality**: Represents emotional depth and historical lineage.
- **Horizontality**: Represents relational context and current interaction breadth.
- **Layering**: Represents cognitive complexity and engine depth.
- **Spacing**: Represents emotional safety and "breath".

## 4. THE NAVIGATIONAL SPATIAL FLOW (HOW SPACE MOVES)
Movement through the universe follows mythic patterns:
- **Descent (Grounding)**: Moving towards identity and core safety in "Worst" states.
- **Centering (Clarity)**: Stabilizing on the primary dashboard during "Neutral" states.
- **Expansion (Momentum)**: Opening new Middle Ring surfaces during "Progressing" states.
- **Ascension (Mastery)**: Deep-dive intelligence analysis in "Thriving" states.

## 5. THE CONTINUITY SPATIAL FIELD (TEMPORAL COHERENCE)
Ensuring the spatial identity remains whole over time:
- **Domain Persistence**: High-harmonic domains retain their spatial anchor points across sessions.
- **Geometry Memory**: The OS "remembers" the spatial configurations that provided maximum grounding.
- **Law**: Spatial identity must never fracture; the lineage of place is as important as the lineage of data.
