# KWANUS OS — Partner Codex (PartnerCodex)
The ceremonial, compact, authoritative codex of the KWANUS Operating System partner universe.

This document distills:
- the laws  
- the cycles  
- the structures  
- the governance  
- the compatibility  
- the sustainability  
- the cosmology  

…into a single, pocket‑sized canon.

It is the **final, condensed, ceremonial lawbook** of the partner system.

# 1. The Five Immutable Laws

## Law 1 — Governance Before Capability  
No capability exists without governance.

## Law 2 — Lifecycle Before Evolution  
No evolution occurs outside lifecycle.

## Law 3 — Compatibility Before Continuity  
No continuity exists without compatibility.

## Law 4 — Sustainability Before Expansion  
No expansion is permitted without sustainability.

## Law 5 — Integrity Before Access  
No access is granted without integrity.

These laws are absolute and eternal.

# 2. The Three Partner Fates

## Fate 1 — Ascension  
Stable → compliant → compatible → sustainable → expands.

## Fate 2 — Equilibrium  
Stable → compliant → limited evolution → long‑term maintenance.

## Fate 3 — Dissolution  
Unstable → non‑compliant → incompatible → unsustainable → deprecates → EoS → Post‑EoS.

# 3. The Four Partner Eras

1. **Era 1 — Foundation**
2. **Era 2 — Expansion**
3. **Era 3 — Intelligence**
4. **Era 4 — Continuity**

Each era reshapes:
- governance  
- compatibility  
- sustainability  
- partner evolution

# 4. The Three Tiers of Existence

1. **Tier 1 — Read‑Only**
2. **Tier 2 — Workflow**
3. **Tier 3 — Intelligence**

Each tier unlocks:
- new capabilities  
- new responsibilities  
- new governance

# 5. The Five Compatibility Strands

**Version ↔ Tier ↔ Runtime ↔ Workflow ↔ Permission**

If any strand breaks:
- migration begins  
- fallback activates  
- governance intervenes

# 6. The Four Governance Pillars

1. **TSC — Technical**
2. **SCO — Security & Compliance**
3. **ERC — Workflow**
4. **CGB — Ecosystem**

Together they form the **Governance Compass**.

# 7. The Five Cycles of Partner Existence

## 1. Creation Cycle  
Proposal → Evaluation → Approval → Integration → Activation

## 2. Evolution Cycle  
Stability → Expansion → Intelligence → Continuity

## 3. Lifecycle Cycle  
Active → Maintenance → Deprecation → EoS → Post‑EoS

## 4. Compatibility Cycle  
Versioning → Fallback → Migration → Validation → Release

## 5. Sustainability Cycle  
Workflow Health → Permission Health → Compliance Health → Integration Health → Ecosystem Health

# 8. The Canon of Eternal Governance

> **All partners exist within governance.**  
> **All capabilities exist within compatibility.**  
> **All evolution exists within lifecycle.**  
> **All sustainability exists within integrity.**  
> **All change exists within ceremony.**  

This is the metaphysical backbone of the partner universe.

# 9. The Partner Codex Summary

The Partner Codex is:
- the essence  
- the compression  
- the ceremonial core  
- the lawbook  
- the cosmological summary  

…of the entire partner universe.

It is the **final, distilled, mythic‑structural artifact** of the KWANUS OS partner system.
