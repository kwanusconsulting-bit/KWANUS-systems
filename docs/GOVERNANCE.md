# KWANUS OS: OPERATIONAL GOVERNANCE MODEL

This model defines the internal laws, protocols, and decision-making structures that ensure the KWANUS OS remains coherent, stable, and emotionally safe.

---

## 1. THE CONTINUITY LAWS (THE UNBREAKABLE RULES)
The foundational laws that protect the lineage:
- **No Resets**: The OS only moves forward. The past is a foundation, never a regret.
- **No Overwrites**: New features are additive layers. They extend the universe without deleting its history.
- **No Regressions**: System intelligence and emotional safety metrics must never decrease during an update.
- **No Fragmentation**: All domains (Emotional, Hybrid, Partner) must remain interconnected and synchronized.

---

## 2. THE CHANGE PROTOCOL (HOW THE OS EVOLVES)
A ceremonial pathway for system evolution:
1. **Proposal**: Conceptual definition of the intended expansion.
2. **Impact Mapping**: Evaluation of effects on all core engines (Emotion, Hybrid, Partner).
3. **Continuity Check**: Verification against the foundational Continuity Laws.
4. **Integration**: Implementation as a respectful, additive layer.
5. **Ceremonial Activation**: Formal inclusion into the OS's material lineage.

## 3. THE EMOTIONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL
The care architecture of the universe:
- **State-Gating**: Surfaces and insights must be gated by the user's emotional intensity.
- **Instability Shield**: No predictive or confrontational insights are surfaced during "Instability" or "Worst" states.
- **Grounding Mandate**: Every complex or emotional flow must provide an immediate, visible "Grounding" escape.
- **Non-Contradiction**: The system must never provide feedback that contradicts the user's current emotional resonance.

---

## 4. THE INTELLIGENCE COHERENCE MODEL
Rules of inter-system harmony:
- **Emotional Primacy**: The Emotional Engine is the primary signal for all OS behaviors.
- **Hybrid Alignment**: Financial intelligence (Hybrid Engine) must be modulated by emotional capacity.
- **Relational Harmony**: Partner interactions must respect the user's current hybrid and emotional status.
- **Unified Synthesis**: The Insights Engine must synthesize data from all three domains before delivery.

---

## 5. THE STEWARDSHIP PROTOCOL
The responsibility of the Steward (Administrator/System):
- **Integrity Maintenance**: Constant verification of architectural and emotional coherence.
- **Lineage Protection**: Guarding the project history and technical standards.
- **Adaptive Guidance**: Actively adjusted system responses based on long-term stewardship trajectories.
