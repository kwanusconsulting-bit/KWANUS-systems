# KWANUS OS: Architectural Codex

Welcome, Steward. This document defines the foundational laws and mythic structures of the KWANUS Universe.

## 1. Core Pillars
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Every signal in the OS is felt before it is processed. We prioritize resonance over raw throughput.
- **Mythic Modernity**: We build with 2026 precision but design with cosmic intent. Our UI is a ceremony, not just a system.
- **Ceremonial Continuity**: Flow is sacred. State must persist across device surfaces without friction.

## 2. Architectural Guardrails
To preserve the "Soul System" of the OS, we adhere to the following strict laws:

1. **Server-Sovereign Intelligence**:
   - Emotional Engines, Hybrid Recalculations, and Partner Harmonics MUST reside on the server.
   - Client components are for **Experience** and **Affordance**, never for **Inference**.

2. **Event-Driven Resilience**:
   - All cross-domain communication must pass through the global `EventRouter`.
   - Domains (Emotional, Financial, Relational) are decoupled but resonant.

3. **Emotional-Adaptive Layout**:
   - Components must respect the `shouldSimplifyUI` signal.
   - In 'Worst' mode, we protect the user by reducing density and motion.

## 3. The 8-Domain MIA
- **Health**: Physical and mental vitality.
- **Financial**: Prosperity and flow.
- **Relational**: Partner harmonics.
- **Spiritual**: Purpose and alignment.
- **Vocational**: Productivity and mastery.
- **Recreational**: Joy and recovery.
- **Environmental**: Space and sanctuary.
- **Communal**: Narrative and tribe.
