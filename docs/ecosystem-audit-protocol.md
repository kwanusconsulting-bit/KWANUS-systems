# KWANUS OS — Ecosystem Audit Protocol (EcoAuditSpec)
A complete protocol defining how the KWANUS OS ecosystem is audited, how compliance is verified, how violations are handled, and how long‑term ecosystem integrity is maintained.

This document defines:
- audit types  
- audit frequency  
- audit scope  
- audit tools  
- compliance verification  
- extension audit rules  
- partner audit rules  
- API audit rules  
- violation handling  
- remediation requirements  
- long‑term integrity governance  

It ensures the KWANUS OS ecosystem remains safe, compliant, and trustworthy.

- secure  
- compliant  
- resilient  

Audits ensure:
- ecosystem integrity  
- safe extension behavior  
- partner compliance  
- API stability  
- governance enforcement

---

# 7. Extension Audit Rules

## Required Checks
- manifest validity  
- permission usage  
- API usage  
- error logs  
- update frequency  

## High‑Risk Indicators
- excessive permissions  
- external network calls  
- outdated runtimes  
- deprecated API usage  

## Enforcement
- warnings  
- suspension  
- deprecation  
- removal  

---

# 8. Partner Audit Rules

## Required Checks
- workflow reliability  
- compliance alignment  
- permission boundaries  
- API usage patterns  

## High‑Risk Indicators
- repeated failures  
- compliance violations  
- unauthorized data access  

## Enforcement
- remediation plan  
- restricted permissions  
- suspension  

---

# 9. API Audit Rules

## Required Checks
- contract adherence  
- version stability  
- deprecation usage  
- error rate  

## High‑Risk Indicators
- breaking changes  
- undocumented changes  
- deprecated API usage  

## Enforcement
- rollback  
- patch release  
- migration guide  

---

# 10. Violation Handling

## Violation Levels

### Level 1 — Minor
- documentation issues  
- minor permission misuse  
- deprecated API usage  

Action: warning + remediation

### Level 2 — Moderate
- repeated misuse  
- outdated runtimes  
- non‑compliant workflows  

Action: suspension + remediation

### Level 3 — Severe
- security violations  
- unauthorized data access  
- governance violations  

Action: immediate suspension + audit + remediation

---

# 11. Remediation Requirements

## Required Steps
1. identify root cause  
2. submit remediation plan  
3. implement fixes  
4. pass re‑audit  
5. restore access (if applicable)  

## Remediation Window
- minor: 30 days  
- moderate: 14 days  
- severe: immediate + review  

---

# 12. Long‑Term Integrity Governance

## Annual Tasks
