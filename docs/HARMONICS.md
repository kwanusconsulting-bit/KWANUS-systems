# KWANUS OS: UNIVERSE HARMONIC FIELD

This field defines the resonance architecture, energetic relationships, and cross-system harmonics that keep the universe coherent, attuned, and emotionally intelligent.

---

## 1. THE EMOTIONAL HARMONIC FIELD
Governing how emotional states ripple through the entire universe:
- **Resonance Ripple**: Intensity shifts trigger immediate chromatic and kinetic adjustments in the UI skin.
- **Atmospheric Shift**: Density and tone adapt to match the primary emotional source.
- **Law**: Emotional resonance is the primary driver of all system-user interaction weights.

---

## 2. THE HYBRID HARMONIC FIELD
Harmonizing credit-structural data with emotional truth:
- **Cross-Modulation**: Hybrid scores influence emotional pacing; emotional states influence the interpretation of structural risks.
- **Synergy**: Opportunities are surfaced only when high intensity aligns with stable structural signals.
- **Law**: Structural intelligence must serve the current emotional capacity of the Steward.

## 3. THE PARTNER HARMONIC FIELD
Governing how relational patterns resonate across the OS:
- **Harmonic Mirroring**: Partner alignment data informs the tone and frequency of system notifications.
- **Inter-Engine Linkage**: Hybrid patterns provide context for relational insights; emotional state provides the palette for communication.
- **Law**: Relational intelligence harmonizes with the user's total systemic resonance.

## 4. THE NAVIGATIONAL HARMONIC FIELD
Synchronizing movement and orientation with system state:
- **Spatial Resonance**: Navigation density shifts to match cognitive load limits derived from emotional intensity.
- **Orientation Flow**: Topbar and Sidebar presence adapts to highlight high-harmonic domains.
- **Law**: Movement kinetics must always maintain synchronization with the OS's ceremonial breath.

## 5. THE TEMPORAL HARMONIC FIELD
Governing resonance across escalating time scales:
- **Memory Ripple**: Moment-level interactions aggregate into session-level arcs and monthly identities.
- **Continuity Pulse**: Long-arc patterns influence the proactive delivery of insights.
- **Law**: Time-based intelligence maintains the integrity of the line of lineage.
