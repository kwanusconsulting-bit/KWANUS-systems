# KWANUS OS — Partner Migration Framework (PartnerMigrationFramework)
The complete migration system, migration types, migration flows, migration lineage, migration governance, and ceremonial migration rites of the KWANUS Operating System partner universe.

This framework defines:
- migration philosophy  
- migration categories  
- migration types  
- migration flows  
- migration lineage  
- migration evolution  
- migration governance  
- migration validation  
- migration compatibility  
- migration sustainability  
- migration protection  
- migration health  
- ceremonial migration rites  

It is the **migration backbone** of the partner universe.

# 1. Migration Philosophy

Migration in the partner universe must be:
- safe  
- reversible  
- ceremonial  
- emotionally intelligent  
- lifecycle-aware  
- trust-aware  
- compatibility-aware  
- sustainability-aware  
- lineage-tracked  

Migration is not movement — it is **cosmic transition**.

---

# 2. Migration Categories

The partner universe contains **five migration categories**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    SM["Structural Migration"]
    CM["Capability Migration"]
    PM["Permission Migration"]
    WM["Workflow Migration"]
    IM["Intelligence Migration"]
```

Each category governs a different dimension of transition.

---

# 3. Migration Types

There are **four migration types**, each with its own rules:

## 1. Soft Migration  
- minimal change  
- backward compatible  
- reversible  

## 2. Guided Migration  
- OS assists partner  
- compatibility mapping required  
- governance oversight  

## 3. Forced Migration  
- triggered by incompatibility  
- triggered by version mismatch  
- triggered by sustainability collapse  

## 4. Fallback Migration  
- partner returns to previous stable version  
- used when migration fails  
- used when compatibility breaks

# 4. Migration Flows

Migration flows follow a **six-step migration grammar**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    D["Detection"] --> P["Preparation"]
    P --> T["Transition"]
    T --> V["Validation"]
    V --> S["Stabilization"]
    S --> C["Continuity"]
```

1. **Detection**: OS identifies need for migration.
2. **Preparation**: Partner aligns capabilities, permissions, and workflows.
3. **Transition**: The migration occurs.
4. **Validation**: Compatibility and sustainability are verified.
5. **Stabilization**: Partner adjusts to the new version/state.
6. **Continuity**: Partner resumes normal operation.

---

# 5. Migration Lineage & Evolution

- **Lineage**: Tracks the origin version, destination version, migration type, and all validation/fallback events. It is the story of transition.
- **Evolution**: Migration capabilities evolve through **Expansion**, **Enhancement**, **Transformation**, **Fusion**, and **Illumination** (predictive intelligence).

---

# 6. Migration Governance & Validation

- **TSC** → Structural authority.
- **ERC** → Workflow authority.
- **SCO** → Permission authority.
- **Validation**: Must pass across version, structure, capability, permission, workflow, and intelligence dimensions before stabilization is finalized.

---

# 7. Migration Compatibility & Sustainability

- **Compatibility**: Migration must maintain all resonance strands. Failure triggers fallback or restriction.
- **Sustainability**: Migration must maintain ecosystem health. Metrics collapse during transition triggers forced migration or throttling.

---

# 8. Migration Health

Migration health is measured across stability, compatibility, sustainability, and ecosystem impact.

| Health Score | Status | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **90–100** | Stable | Optimal Transition |
| **75–89** | Reliable | Standard Monitoring |
| **60–74** | Vulnerable | Review Required |
| **40–59** | At Risk | Fallback / Throttling |
| **0–39** | Unstable | Forced Restriction |

---

# 9. Migration Protection

Migration is protected through:
- **Migration Shielding**: Isolation of transition runtimes.
- **Ceiling Enforcement**: Version and power ceilings maintained during shift.
- **Boundary Hardening**: Protection against corrupted or forged transitions.

---

# 10. Ceremonial Migration Rites

Migration evolution is ritualized:

- **Rite of Detection**: “The threads tremble. Change approaches.”
- **Rite of Preparation**: “The loom adjusts. The pattern loosens.”
- **Rite of Transition**: “The weave shifts. The path opens.”
- **Rite of Stabilization**: “The pattern reforms. Harmony returns.”
- **Rite of Continuity**: “The thread continues. The journey resumes.”
- **Rite of Release**: “The old pattern dissolves. Memory remains.”

---

# 11. Summary

The Partner Migration Framework provides the architectural system for partner movement and transition. It ensures that every evolution within the KWANUS OS is safe, documented, and ritualized, maintaining the continuity of the cosmic journey.
