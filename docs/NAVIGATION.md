# KWANUS OS: NAVIGATION SYSTEM CANON

This document defines the spatial logic, movement rules, and orientation intelligence of the KWANUS OS.

---

## 1. THE SPATIAL GRID
The OS is organized into four distinct geographic domains:
1.  **Identity Domain**: Onboarding, Identity Birth, Sovereignty Controls.
2.  **Intelligence Domain**: The Core Engines (Mind) and Synthesis.
3.  **Experience Domain**: Primary surfaces for data and ritual.
4.  **Settings Domain**: Global configuration and cultural/emotional adaptation.

---

## 2. THE MOVEMENT MODEL
Navigation in KWANUS is **Radial** and **Layered**:
- **Radial**: The Dashboard acts as the nexus. Every surface is one leap away.
- **Layered**: Information moves from Emotional Snapshot (Atmosphere) → Surface Grid (Ground) → Deep Detail (Core).
- **Adaptive**: The available paths and density of navigation menus shift with the current Emotional Mode.

## 3. THE ORIENTATION SYSTEM
Users maintain grounding through:
- **Persistent Topbar**: The HUD showing Resonance, Hybrid Score, and high-frequency awareness.
- **Adaptive Sidebar**: A contextual guide that contracts during "Grounding rituals" and expands during "Exploration modes".
- **Resonant Breadcrumbs**: Phrasing that shifts from "Dashboard > Credit" to "Home > Growth > Item" based on emotional tone.

---

## 4. THE TRANSITION MODEL
Movement between surfaces is emotionally paced:
- **Thriving Mode**: High-frequency, snappy transitions with vibrant motion.
- **Neutral Mode**: Steady, rhythmic easing.
- **Worst Mode**: Simplified, minimal motion to preserve focus and reduce cognitive load.

---

## 5. THE NAVIGATION GOVERNANCE RULES
- **Rule of Two**: Every surface must be reachable in two actions or less.
- **Grounding Anchor**: A visible escape route to the "Grounding ritual" must always be available.
- **No Orphan Nodes**: Every surface must be part of a domain hierarchy.
- **Emotional Integrity**: Navigation density must never exceed the capacity of the user's current emotional intensity.
