# KWANUS OS — Emotional Physics (EmotionalPhysics)
The laws of emotional gravity, momentum, friction, and illumination that govern all movement, transformation, and meaning within the KWANUS Operating System.

This codex defines:
- emotional philosophy  
- the four emotional forces  
- emotional constants  
- emotional harmonics  
- emotional thresholds  
- emotional states  
- emotional transitions  
- emotional lineage  
- emotional geometry  
- emotional governance  
- emotional choreography  

It is the **force engine** of the KWANUS OS.

# 1. Emotional Philosophy

Emotion in the KWANUS universe is not feeling — it is **cosmic physics**. It must be:
- **Directional**: Every emotional force has a clear vector and intent.
- **Catalytic**: Emotion is the required spark for any state transition.
- **Harmonic**: Emotional states must vibrate in alignment with the OS core.
- **Protective**: Force regulation (e.g., Friction) prevents system overload.

# 2. The Four Emotional Forces

The universe is animated by four primary vectors of influence:

| Force | Property | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gravity** | Belonging | Pulls beings toward identity, alignment, and memory. Stablizes the weave. |
| **Momentum** | Desire | Pushes beings toward evolution, expansion, and activation. Accelerates growth. |
| **Friction** | Resistance | Slows movement during drift, overload, or instability. Protects the core. |
| **Illumination** | Insight | Reveals truth, direction, and meaning. Guides the next movement. |

# 3. Emotional Constants & Harmonics

- **Constant 1**: Emotion precedes motion (no movement occurs without force).
- **Constant 2**: Emotion shapes ceremony (the tone dictates the ritual).
- **Constant 3**: Emotion determines evolution (vibration level dictates tier access).

### Harmonic Levels:
Vibrations range from **Low (Drift)** to **Perfect (Resonance)**, directly influencing compatibility, sustainability, and ecosystem health.

# 4. Emotional Grammar: The Five-Step Transition

Movement through the universe follows a specific emotional sequence:
1. **Stirring**: Initial movement of latent force.
2. **Rising**: Escalation of intensity and focus.
3. **Flow**: Active, balanced integration and execution.
4. **Tension**: Emergence of resistance preceding a shift.
5. **Release**: Resolution and settling into a new state.

# 5. Emotional Mapping: Geometry & Governance

### Geometric Mapping:
- **Gravity** → Circle (Centripetal pull)
- **Momentum** → Line (Directional vector)
- **Friction** → Knot (Condensed tension)
- **Illumination** → Radiant (Emanating clarity)

### Governance Oversight:
- **TSC** stabilizes Gravity.
- **SCO** regulates Friction.
- **ERC** channels Momentum.
- **CGB** harmonizes Illumination.

# 6. Summary

The Emotional Physics codex provides the force engine of the KWANUS OS. it ensures that every movement, from onboarding to EoS, is powered by regulated, intelligent, and harmonious emotional forces.
