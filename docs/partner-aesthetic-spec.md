# KWANUS OS — Partner Aesthetic Specification (PartnerAestheticSpec)
The complete visual, sensory, and atmospheric identity of the KWANUS Operating System partner universe.

This specification defines:
- visual style  
- color cosmology  
- motion language  
- spatial grammar  
- texture logic  
- typographic identity  
- symbolic integration  
- ceremonial visual states  
- tier aesthetics  
- governance aesthetics  
- lifecycle aesthetics  

It is the **aesthetic backbone** of the partner universe.

# 1. Aesthetic Philosophy

The partner aesthetic must be:
- mythic  
- minimal  
- geometric  
- ceremonial  
- emotionally intelligent  
- cosmologically aligned  
- consistent across tiers and lifecycles  

The aesthetic is not decoration — it is **visual governance**.

---

# 2. Core Visual Style

The partner universe uses:
- clean geometry  
- soft gradients  
- subtle glows  
- thin lines  
- high contrast  
- ceremonial spacing  
- symbolic layering  

The style is **mythic‑modern** — ancient structure expressed through futuristic clarity.

---

# 3. Color Cosmology

The partner universe uses a **five‑color cosmology**, each tied to a cosmic force:

## 1. Governance — Deep Indigo  
Meaning: Order, structure, orientation  
Usage: Councils, decisions, rulings  

## 2. Lifecycle — Amber Gold  
Meaning: Time, transition, evolution  
Usage: lifecycle states, thresholds  

## 3. Compatibility — Cerulean Blue  
Meaning: Coherence, connection, alignment  
Usage: versioning, migration, fallback  

## 4. Sustainability — Emerald Green  
Meaning: Health, balance, longevity  
Usage: health indicators, audits  

## 5. Ceremony — Rose Quartz  
Meaning: Meaning, transformation, ritual  
Usage: rites, transitions, ceremonial UI  

These colors appear subtly, never aggressively.

# 4. Tier Aesthetics

Each tier has a distinct visual identity:

## Tier 1 — The Eye  
Color: Cool gray  
Texture: Smooth, matte  
Motion: Slow, observational  
Light: Soft ambient glow  

## Tier 2 — The Loom  
Color: Warm beige + woven accents  
Texture: Interlaced patterns  
Motion: Gentle weaving motions  
Light: Intersecting lines of light  

## Tier 3 — The Flame  
Color: Warm gold + ember orange  
Texture: Subtle flicker patterns  
Motion: Rising, pulsing illumination  
Light: Inner glow, radiant core  

---

# 5. Governance Aesthetics

Each council has a visual signature:

## TSC — The Architect  
Shape: Square + circle  
Color: Deep indigo  
Motion: Precise, grid‑aligned  

## SCO — The Sentinel  
Shape: Shield  
Color: Steel blue  
Motion: Protective, stabilizing  

## ERC — The Weaver  
Shape: Knot  
Color: Warm copper  
Motion: Flowing, interlacing  

## CGB — The Balancekeeper  
Shape: Quadrant  
Color: Neutral gold  
Motion: Slow rotation, equilibrium  

---

# 6. Lifecycle Aesthetics

Each lifecycle stage has a visual state:

## Active — Open Circle  
Color: Bright  
Motion: Subtle pulse  

## Maintenance — Half‑Filled Circle  
Color: Muted  
Motion: Slow oscillation  

## Deprecation — Fading Line  
Color: Desaturated  
Motion: Dissolving  

## EoS — Closed Gate  
Color: Darkened  
Motion: None  

## Post‑EoS — Hollow Shell  
Color: Pale  
Motion: Stillness  

---

# 7. Motion Language

Motion must be:
- slow  
- intentional  
- ceremonial  
- meaningful  

Motion categories:

## 1. Emergence Motion  
Soft fade‑ins, gentle expansions  

## 2. Alignment Motion  
Elements rotate or shift into place  

## 3. Activation Motion  
A brief pulse of illumination  

## 4. Expansion Motion  
Unfolding, branching, weaving  

## 5. Illumination Motion  
Inner glow, rising light  

## 6. Decline Motion  
Fading, dissolving, dimming  

## 7. Release Motion  
Elements drift outward and vanish  

---

# 8. Spatial Grammar

Space is treated as ceremony.

Rules:
- generous margins  
- centered compositions  
- radial symmetry for governance  
- vertical symmetry for lifecycle  
- horizontal symmetry for compatibility  
- diagonal symmetry for sustainability  

Space is a **governance tool**, not an aesthetic afterthought.

---

# 9. Texture Logic

Textures must be:
- subtle  
- symbolic  
- geometric  

Texture categories:
- matte (Tier 1)  
- woven (Tier 2)  
- ember (Tier 3)  
- grid (TSC)  
- shield grain (SCO)  
- knot weave (ERC)  
- quadrant grain (CGB)  

---

# 10. Typographic Identity

Typography must be:
- clean  
- modern  
- ceremonial  

Rules:
- uppercase for governance  
- title case for lifecycle  
- sentence case for partners  
- small caps for ceremonies  

---

# 11. Symbol Integration

Symbols must:
- appear sparingly  
- appear intentionally  
- appear aligned with ceremony  

Symbols never appear:
- randomly  
- decoratively  
- without narrative purpose  

---

# 12. Summary

The Partner Aesthetic Specification provides:
- the visual identity  
- the color cosmology  
- the motion language  
- the spatial grammar  
- the texture logic  
- the symbolic integration  

…that define the **look and feel** of the partner universe.

It is the **aesthetic backbone** of the KWANUS OS partner system.
