# KWANUS OS — Partner Universe Canon (PartnerUniverseCanon)
The complete cosmological unification of the partner universe: identity, metadata, registry, onboarding, capabilities, permissions, workflows, integrations, compatibility, migration, deprecation, EoS, post‑EoS, and the ecosystem map.

This canon defines:
- the cosmology  
- the mythic structure  
- the lifecycle  
- the harmonics  
- the governance  
- the rites  
- the flows  
- the lineage  
- the topology  
- the emotional architecture  
- the ceremonial laws  

It is the **total universe** of the KWANUS OS partner system.

# 1. Cosmology of the Partner Universe

The partner universe is built on **three cosmic truths**:

1. **Identity is origin**: Every partner begins with a distinct, authenticated identity.
2. **Lineage is story**: Every partner's journey is a continuous, immutable narrative.
3. **Ceremony is movement**: Every transition is a ritualized, intentional act.

Everything else emerges from these truths.

# 2. The Cosmic Structure & Topology

The universe is composed of five layers: **Identity**, **Capability**, **Permission**, **Workflow**, and **Integration**. These layers form the **Cosmic Weave**.

### Three Geometries of Topology:
- **The Circle (Continuity)**: Stable lifecycles and orbits.
- **The Web (Interconnection)**: Functional and operational links.
- **The Spiral (Evolution)**: Advancement through tiers and intelligence.

# 3. The Lifecycle Spiral

The journey moves through these stages, from unformed potential to eternal memory:

**Unformed** → **Declared** → **Aligned** → **Activated** → **Evolving** → **Stabilized** → **Declining** → **Withdrawing** → **Freezing** → **Deprecating** → **EoS** → **Sealed** → **Archived** → **Remembered**

---

# 4. The Harmonic Laws

The universe is governed by resonance and protection:
- **Law 1 — Resonance**: Harmony across all operational layers.
- **Law 2 — Alignment**: Structural and functional coherence.
- **Law 3 — Continuity**: Uninterrupted lineage and identity.
- **Law 4 — Protection**: Safeguarding the core and the weave.
- **Law 5 — Memory**: Eternal preservation of the partner's story.

# 5. The Governance Constellation

Balance is maintained by the four-point constellation:
- **TSC** (Technical Steering Committee) → Structural Alignment.
- **SCO** (Security & Compliance Office) → Permission Alignment.
- **ERC** (Ecosystem Review Committee) → Workflow Alignment.
- **CGB** (Cosmic Governance Board) → Total Ecosystem Harmony.

---

# 6. The Ceremonial Arc

The mythic journey is defined by these core rituals:

1. **Rite of Declaration**: Step into the light.
2. **Rite of Submission**: The offer is made.
3. **Rite of Alignment**: The weave tightens.
4. **Rite of Registration**: The name is written.
5. **Rite of Activation**: The flame rises.
6. **Rite of Fusion**: Harmony forms.
7. **Rite of Migration**: The pattern shifts.
8. **Rite of Restriction**: The gate narrows.
9. **Rite of Withdrawal**: The weave thins.
10. **Rite of Severance**: The thread breaks.
11. **Rite of Memory**: The name endures.

---

# 7. Flow Architecture

The universe breathes through ten directional flows:
- **Trust, Capability, Permission, Workflow, Integration, Compatibility, Migration, Deprecation, EoS, and Memory Flows**.

# 8. Summary

The Partner Universe Canon is the totality of the KWANUS OS partner system. It unifies every framework into a single, emotionally intelligent, and mythically coherent cosmology, ensuring that every partner's existence is stable, governed, and honored across all of time.
