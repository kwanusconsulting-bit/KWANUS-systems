# KWANUS OS: EXPERIENCE FLOW MAPS

This canon defines the journey architecture of the KWANUS OS—how users move through the universe and how the system responds.

---

## 1. THE ORIENTATION FLOW (DASHBOARD-CENTRIC)
The primary loop of awareness.
- **Path**: Dashboard → Emotional Snapshot → Hybrid Score → Partner Harmonics → Insights.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: 
    - **Worst**: Dashboard simplifies into a grounding-only view. 
    - **Thriving**: Full intelligence mode unlocks cross-domain overlays.

---

## 2. THE EMOTIONAL FLOW (CHECK-IN → TIMELINE → INSIGHTS)
The OS's metabolism of feeling.
- **Path**: Check-In → Event Creation → Engine Update → Timeline Refresh → Insight Synthesis.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: 
    - **Worst**: Slow, deliberate motion. No aggressive insights.
    - **Thriving**: Predictive insights unlocked; expressive transitions.

---

## 3. THE HYBRID FLOW (CREDIT → EMOTION → INSIGHT)
The synthesis of structure and feeling.
- **Path**: Credit Item Open → Recalculation → Emotional Impact Display → Risk/Opportunity Surfacing.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: 
    - **Worst**: Focus on stability and essentials.
    - **Thriving**: Full speculative mapping and complex debt/emotion projections.

---

## 4. THE RELATIONAL FLOW (PARTNERS → HARMONICS → MESSAGES)
The OS's relational mind.
- **Path**: Partner Universe → Harmonic Load → Interaction History → Alignment Patterns → Contextual Messaging.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: 
    - **Worst**: High-clarity, simplified partner status.
    - **Thriving**: Deep harmonic mapping and predictive relational trends.

---

## 5. THE EXECUTION FLOW (TASKS → NOTES → DASHBOARD)
The action-intelligence loop.
- **Path**: Tasks → Emotional Tagging → Hybrid Linking → Note Connection → Dashboard Synergy.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: 
    - **Worst**: Reduced task visibility to prevent overwhelm.
    - **Thriving**: High-density multi-panel productivity mode.

---

## GOVERNANCE
- **Continuity**: No flow should exit without a clear path back to the Dashboard (Nexus).
- **Graceful Degradation**: If an engine fails, the flow must revert to a simplified "Stability State".
