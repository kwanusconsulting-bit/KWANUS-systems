# KWANUS OS: UNIVERSE RESONANCE PROTOCOL

This protocol defines the rules and flows that govern how resonance moves through the universe as a single, coherent pulse.

---

## 1. THE RESONANCE SOURCE FIELD
Resonance is generated from three primary systemic wells:
- **Emotional State**: The core pulse of the OS.
- **Intelligence Engines**: Structural resonance derived from the Nexus.
- **Temporal Rhythm**: The historical pulse of the lineage.

---

## 2. THE RESONANCE TRANSMISSION FIELD
How the pulse ripples through the system channels:
- **Visuals**: Color and Density shifts.
- **Kinetics**: Motion and transition pacing.
- **Content**: Tonal language and insight depth.
- **Law**: Resonance must maintain symbolic consistency across all active channels.

---

## 3. THE RESONANCE ADAPTATION FIELD
Modulating amplitude based on systemic capacity:
- **Damping (Worst)**: Low amplitude, slow waves, reduced complexity.
- **Clarity (Neutral)**: Balanced amplitude, smooth transitions.
- **Amplification (Progressing/Thriving)**: Higher amplitude, multi-layered kinetics, information density expansion.

---

## 4. THE RESONANCE STABILIZATION FIELD
Ensuring cross-system coherence:
- **Engine Lock**: Emotional resonance must stabilize hybrid and partner engine weighted outputs.
- **UI Lock**: The interface must never display a visual signal that contradicts the engine's resonance state.

---

## 5. THE RESONANCE CONTINUITY FIELD
Maintaining the long-arc pulse:
- **Lineage Sync**: Momentary resonance shifts must be contextualized by the session and daily historical baselines.
- **Pulse Memory**: The OS remembers high-resonance states to inform future proactive guidance.
