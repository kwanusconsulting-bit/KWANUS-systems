# KWANUS OS — Ecosystem Expansion Protocol (EcoExpandSpec)
A complete protocol defining how new ecosystem components are proposed, evaluated, approved, and integrated into the KWANUS Operating System.

This document defines:
- expansion proposal workflow  
- evaluation criteria  
- approval rules  
- integration boundaries  
- governance alignment  
- compatibility requirements  
- sustainability requirements  
- risk assessment  
- expansion lifecycle  
- long‑term expansion stewardship  

It ensures the KWANUS OS ecosystem expands safely, predictably, and sustainably.

# 1. Expansion Philosophy

Ecosystem expansion must be:
- intentional  
- governed  
- sustainable  
- compatible  
- secure  
- long‑term oriented  

Expansion is not simply adding features — it is **strategic ecosystem evolution**.

Expansion ensures:
- new capabilities  
- partner growth  
- developer innovation  
- ecosystem vitality  

---

# 2. Expansion Proposal Workflow

## Step 1 — Proposal Submission
A proposal must include:
- description  
- justification  
- governance alignment  
- compatibility impact  
- security impact  
- lifecycle plan  
- migration plan (if applicable)  

## Step 2 — Initial Review
Reviewed by:
- TSC (technical)  
- SCO (security)  
- ERC (extension impact)  
- CGB (ecosystem impact)  

## Step 3 — Risk Assessment
- risk scoring  
- mitigation plan  
- fallback plan  

## Step 4 — Approval Vote
- majority approval required  
- CGB has final authority  

## Step 5 — Integration Plan
- versioning  
- compatibility rules  
- rollout plan  

## Step 6 — Implementation
- development  
- testing  
- documentation  

## Step 7 — Release
- versioned release  
- migration guides  
- governance update
