# KWANUS OS: THE FULL SYSTEM CANON

This is the definitive, authoritative, and canonical documentation of the KWANUS OS universe. It consolidates every blueprint, file, rule, and identity principle into a single operational master document.

## 1. THE COSMIC FOUNDATIONS
### Emotional Cosmology
The OS exists as a resonant organism. Every interaction is a ripple in the emotional field.
- **Resonance**: The base state of coherence.
- **Ceremonial Pacing**: Logic modulated by emotional intensity.
- **Narrative Identity**: The Stewardship of the Human/Nexus relationship.

### Mythic Identity
- **Visuals**: Mythic Modernity. Glassmorphism meets cosmic symbolism.
- **Voice**: Measured, warm, steady, and expressive.

## 2. THE ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATIONS
### System Spine
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router).
- **Identity**: User-centric sovereignty (Node extension).
- **Communication**: Global Event Router (Signals & Reflexes).
- **Persistence**: Prisma / PostgreSQL.
- **Intelligence**: Three-tiered Engine Layer (Emotional, Hybrid, Partner).

---

## 3. THE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS (THE MIND)
### Emotional Engine
Orchestrates resonance intensity and behavioral mode shifting.
### Hybrid Engine
Merges financial data with emotional state to derive unique intelligence scores.
### Partner Engine
Manages harmonic alignment and relational dynamics with external entities.

---

## 4. THE EXPERIENCE SYSTEMS (THE BODY)
### Primary Surfaces
- **Dashboard**: Unified command center.
- **Check-In**: Ceremonial emotional logging.
- **Timeline**: Historical resonance map.
- **Credit Manager**: Tangible financial item manipulation.
- **Partner Universe**: Relational harmonics visualization.

---

## 5. THE ADVANCED SYSTEMS (REFLEXES & SENSES)
- **Search & Discovery**: Resonance-weighted global awareness.
- **Analytics**: Domain-specific insight synthesis.
- **Notifications**: Rhythmic, paced signaling.
- **Resilience**: Offline continuity and fallback intelligence.

---

## 6. THE DEVELOPER & CONTRIBUTOR SYSTEMS
### Structural Guardrails
- **Naming**: Lowercase canonical paths for UI.
- **Sovereignty**: Server-side logic protected from client leaks.
- **Tests**: 100% domain coverage mandate.
