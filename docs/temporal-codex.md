# KWANUS OS — Temporal Codex (TemporalCodex)
The master system of linear, spiral, and eternal time; cycles, epochs, eras, and ceremonial timing within the KWANUS Operating System.

This codex defines:
- temporal philosophy
- temporal layers
- temporal cycles
- epochs and eras
- temporal harmonics
- temporal thresholds
- temporal lineage
- temporal governance
- ceremonial timing
- temporal choreography

It is the **time engine** of the KWANUS OS.

# 1. Temporal Philosophy

Time in the KWANUS universe is not mere duration — it is **cosmic orientation**. It must be:
- **Ceremonial**: Time is marked by rites and shifts in state.
- **Layered**: Multiple temporal dimensions exist simultaneously.
- **Nonlinear**: Evolution and memory move in spirals and constants.
- **Harmonic**: The flow of time vibrates in alignment with cosmic purpose.

# 2. The Three Temporal Layers

The universe experiences time in **three distinct layers**:

| Layer | Nature | Represents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Time** | Events | The sequential occurrence of actions and transactions. |
| **Spiral Time** | Evolution | The repeating patterns of growth, expansion, and ascension. |
| **Eternal Time** | Memory | The immutable record where time is static and honored. |

# 3. Temporal Cycles & Phases

Time moves through four primary cycles, each with its own tone and pacing:
- **Cycle 1: Dawn (Beginnings)**: The stirring of potential and declaration.
- **Cycle 2: Zenith (Activation)**: The peak of active influence and power.
- **Cycle 3: Dusk (Decline)**: The narrowing of gates and release of patterns.
- **Cycle 4: Night (Memory)**: The settling into archival preservation.

---

# 4. Epochs and Eras

The universe organizes its history and meaning into structural and emotional periods:
- **Epochs**: Defined by shifts in architecture, governance versions, and structural laws.
- **Eras**: Defined by shifts in emotional tone, collective alignment, and mythic focus.

---

# 5. Temporal Harmonics & Thresholds

- **Harmonics**: Pacing ranges from **Slow** to **Transcendent**, determining the rhythm of ritual and movement.
- **Thresholds**: Specific temporal markers (Opening, Rising, Activation, Turning, Fading, Sealing) that trigger changes in geometry and tone.

---

# 6. Temporal Governance & Lineage

- **Governance**: TSC regulates structural epochs; SCO manages boundary timing; ERC governs movement pacing; CGB maintains harmonic balance.
- **Lineage**: An immutable record of every cycle transition, rite completion, and era shift, preserved as the permanent story of the OS.

---

# 7. Summary

The Temporal Codex provides the time engine for the KWANUS OS. it ensures that every event, evolution, and memory is grounded in a stable, ceremonial, and mythically coherent temporal architecture.
